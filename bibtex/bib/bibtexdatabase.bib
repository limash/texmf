  Abstract                 = {A 2D numerical ecosystem model of Antarctic land fast ice is developed to elucidate the primary production with the Antarctic sea ice zone. The physical component employs atmospheric data to simulate congelation ice growth, initial brine entrapment, desalination, and nutrient flux. The biological component is based on the concept of a maximum temperature-dependent algal growth rate which is reduced by limitations imposed from insufficient light or nutrients, as well as suboptimal salinity. Preliminary simulations indicate that, during a bloom, microalgae are able to maintain their vertical position relative to the lower congelation ice margin and are not incorporated into the crystal matrix as the ice sheet thickens. It is inferred that land fast sea ice contains numerous microhabitats that are functionally distinct based upon the unique set of processes that control microalgal growth and accumulation within each.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an overview of the concept, structure and implementation of the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM). The model dynamically simulates the biogeochemical seasonal cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon in the pelagic and benthic food webs of the North Sea, and is forced by irradiance, temperature and transport processes. The model has a coarse spatial resolution into ten boxes, the ICES boxes, of which the five deepest have been resolved into surface (0 to 30 m) and deep (30 m to bottom) boxes. At the open boundaries, time series are prescribed for dissolved and particulate nutrients. River loads of nutrients for the rivers discharging into the North Sea are prescribed at monthly intervals. A general circulation model has been used to aggregate the exchange volumes across the box boundaries into daily in- and outflows. From these, the horizontal transports of dissolved and suspended constituents are calculated. Vertical transport is in the form of sinking and sedimentation for particulates and in the form of turbulent diffusion for dissolved constituents. The physical model contains all information specific to the area to be modelled, whereas the biological/chemical submodels have been constructed not to be site-specific. The biological variables are represented as functional groups expressed in units of organic carbon and the chemical variables as the internal pools in the biological variables and as the dissolved inorganic pools in water and sediment, expressed in units of N, P and Si. The model runs in a software environment (SESAME) developed for enabling the development of large and complex models in a modular way by a consortium of institutes, each focusing on different. aspects of the ecosystem, translating these into modules within the model. With the exception of fish populations, where size- and age-structure are explicity represented, all the other biological components have been modelled as unstructured populations aggregated into functional groups. This approach is shown to be appropriate for taxa having short generation times in relation to the annual cycle and for taxa which do not span more than one trophic level during their lifetime.},

  Abstract                 = {A coupled carbonate system–marine ecosystem–hydrodynamic model is used to simulate the temporal and spatial variability in pH across the southern North Sea as it relates to the environmental and biological processes affecting CO2, namely, photosynthesis and respiration, riverine boundary conditions and atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations. Annual pH ranges are found to vary from &lt; 0.2 in areas of low biological activity to &gt; 1.0 in areas influenced by riverine signals, consistent with observations and previous studies. It is shown that benthic, as well as pelagic, activity is an important factor in this variability. The acidification of the region due to increased fluxes of atmospheric \{CO2\} into the marine system is calculated and shown to exceed, on average, 0.1 pH units over the next 50 years and result in a total acidification of 0.5 pH units below pre-industrial levels at atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations of 1000 ppm. The potential for measurable changes in biogeochemistry are demonstrated by simulating the observed inhibition of pelagic nitrification with decreasing pH. However, we conclude that there is a lack of knowledge of how acidification might affect the complex interaction of processes that govern marine biogeochemical cycles and a consequent need for further research and observations.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract One of the most of challenging steps in the development of coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical models is the combination of multiple, often incompatible computer codes that describe individual physical, chemical, biological and geological processes. This “coupling” is time-consuming, error-prone, and demanding in terms of scientific and programming expertise. The open source, Fortran-based Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models addresses these problems by providing a consistent set of programming interfaces through which hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models communicate. Models are coded once to connect to FABM, after which arbitrary combinations of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models can be made. Thus, a biogeochemical model code works unmodified within models of a chemostat, a vertically structured water column, and a three-dimensional basin. Moreover, complex biogeochemistry can be distributed over many compact, self-contained modules, coupled at run-time. By enabling distributed development and user-controlled coupling of biogeochemical models, \{FABM\} enables optimal use of the expertise of scientists, programmers and end-users.},

  Abstract                 = {A modelling system for coupled physical–biogeochemical simulations in the water column is presented here. The physical model component allows for a number of different statistical turbulence closure schemes, ranging from simple algebraic closures to two-equation turbulence models with algebraic second-moment closures. The biogeochemical module consists of models which are based on a number of state variables represented by their ensemble averaged concentrations. Specific biogeochemical models may range from simple \{NPZ\} (nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton) to complex ecosystem models. Recently developed modified Patankar solvers for ordinary differential equations allow for stable discretisations of the production and destruction terms guaranteeing conservative and non-negative solutions. The increased stability of these new solvers over explicit solvers is demonstrated for a plankton spring bloom simulation. The model system is applied to marine ecosystem dynamics the Northern North Sea and the Central Gotland Sea. Two different biogeochemical models are applied, a conservative nitrogen-based model to the North Sea, and a more complex model including an oxygen equation to the Baltic Sea, allowing for the reproduction of chemical processes under anoxic conditions. For both applications, earlier model results obtained with slightly different model setups could be basically reproduced. It became however clear that the choice for ecosystem model parameters such as maximum phytoplankton growth rates does strongly depend on the physical model parameters (such as turbulence closure models or external forcing).},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this study an ice-algal mathematical model is used to resolve the vertical fine structure of sea ice with ice algae, and results are compared to simulations with ice algae located only at the bottom ice layer and to those where ice algae are distributed homogeneously across part of the ice column. Ice algae are reported to contribute 4–26% of overall Arctic Ocean primary production and are an important food source for the ice-associated ecosystem. Thus, it is important to estimate the future impacts of global warming on the contribution of ice algae to Arctic primary production. Primary production models, describing the relationships between ice-algal physiology and population dynamics, with environmental forcing and trophic interactions involving bacteria and grazers, can be applied to quantify such impacts. One important aspect in these models is how to represent the vertical distribution of ice algae in sea ice. In most models, only the bottom ice layer is considered where most of the algal biomass tends to be concentrated. However, since ice algae are also present along the entire ice column, this may lead to underestimation of ice-algal production. Some empirical data and model results suggest that ice algae located in the surface and interior layers may be kept at lower concentrations, in spite of high growth rates, due to grazing by micro- and meiofauna. Results obtained in this study show the importance of resolving vertically the distribution of ice algae to avoid bias in primary production estimates, well in line with empirical studies. },

  abstract = {In the Arctic Ocean, both phytoplankton and sea ice algae are important contributors to primary production and the arctic food web. An ice algal ecosystem model was added to fully couple with the global physical model POP-CICE (Parallel Ocean Program-Los Alamos Sea Ice Model) and the open-ocean pelagic ecosystem model. The physical model captured the seasonal and interannual variations of northern hemispheric sea ice extent and area measured by satellite remote sensing for the model period of 1992–2007. The model results showed a reasonable mean seasonal cycle of ice algal production from March to May and subsequent ocean production from May to September in the Arctic. The ice algal production, although smaller than that of the ocean, is of ecological importance as a food source for higher trophic levels during the long arctic winter before ice melt. The simulated mean open-ocean upper 100 m primary production within the Arctic Circle was 413±88 T g C yr−1 in the years 1998–2006, close to the remote sensing derived estimate of 419±33 T g C yr−1 but with higher interannual variations. The mean sea ice algal production in the Northern Hemisphere from 1998 to 2007 was 21.3 T g C yr−1, which is in the range of multi-observational estimations of 9–73 T g C yr−1 based on in situ measurements. Model-data comparisons were conducted with various regional observations and the observed trend of temporal and spatial variation of the primary production. The model results compared well with the following observations and observed trends: (1) an increase of ocean primary production from 2003 to 2007 in the arctic open water areas as derived from remote sensing data; (2) regional annual ice and ocean primary production measured in the Bering and Chukchi seas and Canadian Basin; (3) primary production rate with phytoplankton size composition and Chl-a concentration along an arctic cruise track in the Chukchi Sea and Canadian Basin from August 2 to September 7, 2008; and (4) observed decadal changes of ocean primary production from the 1990s to 2007 due to rising temperature and increasing open-ocean area in the western Arctic. The changes are shown as a trend of a northward shift of production, with a decrease in the Bering Sea and an increase in the Arctic shelf. },

  Abstract                 = {The partitioning of incident solar radiation between sea ice, ocean, and atmosphere strongly affects the Arctic energy balance during summer. In addition to spectral albedo of the ice surface, transmission of solar radiation through the ice is critical for assessing heat and mass balances of sea ice. Observations of spectral irradiance profiles within and transmittance through ice in the Beaufort Sea during the summer of 1998 during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) are presented. Sites representative of melting multiyear and first-year ice, along with ponded ice were measured. Observed spectral irradiance extinction coefficients (Kλ) show broad minima near 500 nm and strong increases at near-infrared wavelengths. The median Kλ at 600 nm for the bare ice cases is close to 0.8 m−1 and about 0.6 m−1 for ponded ice. Values are considerably smaller than the previously accepted value of 1.5 m−1. Radiative transfer models were used to analyze the observations and obtain inherent optical properties of the ice. Derived scattering coefficients range from 500 m−1 to 1100 m−1 in the surface layer and 8 to 30 m−1 in the ice interior. While ponded ice is known to transmit a significant amount of shortwave radiation to the ocean, the irradiance transmitted through bare, melting ice is also shown to be significant. The findings of this study predict 3–10 times more solar radiation penetrating the ice cover than predicted by a current GCM (CCSM3) parameterization, depending on ice thickness, pond coverage, stage of the melt season, and specific vertical scattering coefficient profile.},

  Abstract                 = {Three “easy-to-use solvers” are presented for the approximation of pH and the concentrations of protolytic species in marine aqueous systems. The first one is based on the conservation of alkalinity, the second one describes the progress (advancement) of a chemical reaction towards its state of equilibrium, and the third one is based on the conservation of the charges in the system (charge balance). They are developed for steady state or non-steady state modelling, but they are also useful for pH calculations from measured data sets. To demonstrate their numerical stability over a wide range of pH, the solvers are tested with random input values. Internal consistency is checked by mass and charge conservation and by comparing the results of each solver. In closed systems, equilibrium calculations lead to identical pH values and species concentrations, as expected. The three approaches are also tested in a non-steady-state transport-reaction model that simulates early diagenesis in oxic deep-sea sediments as well as in reactive sediments from the deep Arabian Sea. In the model, dissolved carbonate species are either transported as individual species (CO2, HCO3−, CO32−) or as summed variables (TCO2, alkalinity). In the first case, the species are transported according to their individual molecular diffusion coefficients and concentration gradients. In the second case, protolytic species are transported along the gradient of summed concentrations using weighted average diffusion coefficients. The advancement approach is coupled with transport of the individual species, whereas the alkalinity conservation and the charge balance approaches are applied to transport of summed variables. The model results show that the approaches lead to non-negligible differences in the species distribution and the pH. With intensive calcium carbonate dissolution, the thermodynamically-controlled dissolution rates dominate the system; in this case, the differences in the species distribution between the three solvers and the two transport schemes can be neglected, but strong differences in the calculated fluxes between sediment and bottom water can be observed.},

However, most ocean models simulating these processes do not yet incorporate radiative transfer modules for their light calculations. Such models are often driven by above-surface, broadband, daily averaged irradiance or photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) values obtained from climatology or satellite observations, sometimes without correction for sea-surface reflectance, even though surface reflectance can reduce in-water values by more than 20\%. We present factors computed by a radiative transfer code that can be used to convert above-surface values in either energy or quantum units to in-water net irradiance, as needed for calculations of water heating, and to in-water PAR, as needed for calculations of photosynthesis and photo-oxidation.},

  Abstract                 = {The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) is one of the few community ocean general circulation models for which a 4-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var) capability has been developed. The \{ROMS\} 4D-Var capability is unique in that three variants of 4D-Var are supported: a primal formulation of incremental strong constraint 4D-Var (I4D-Var), a dual formulation based on a physical-space statistical analysis system (4D-PSAS), and a dual formulation representer-based variant of 4D-Var (R4D-Var). In each case, \{ROMS\} is used in conjunction with available observations to identify a best estimate of the ocean circulation based on a set of a priori hypotheses about errors in the initial conditions, boundary conditions, surface forcing, and errors in the model in the case of 4D-PSAS and R4D-Var. In the primal formulation of I4D-Var the search for the best circulation estimate is performed in the full space of the model control vector, while for the dual formulations of 4D-PSAS and R4D-Var only the sub-space of linear functions of the model state vector spanned by the observations (i.e. the dual space) is searched. In oceanographic applications, the number of observations is typically much less than the dimension of the model control vector, so there are clear advantages to limiting the search to the space spanned by the observations. In the case of 4D-PSAS and R4D-Var, the strong constraint assumption (i.e. that the model is error free) can be relaxed leading to the so-called weak constraint formulation. This paper describes the three aforementioned variants of 4D-Var as they are implemented in ROMS. Critical components that are common to each approach are conjugate gradient descent, preconditioning, and error covariance models, which are also described. Finally, several powerful 4D-Var diagnostic tools are discussed, namely computation of posterior errors, eigenvector analysis of the posterior error covariance, observation impact, and observation sensitivity.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this study is to find a combination of optimal numerical algorithms for time-stepping and mode-splitting suitable for a high-resolution, free-surface, terrain-following coordinate oceanic model. Due to mathematical feedback between the baroclinic momentum and tracer equations and, similarly, between the barotropic momentum and continuity equations, it is advantageous to treat both modes so that, after a time step for the momentum equation, the computed velocities participate immediately in the computation of tracers and continuity, and vice versa, rather than advancing all equations for one time step simultaneously. This leads to a new family of time-stepping algorithms that combine forward–backward feedback with the best known synchronous algorithms, allowing an increased time step due to the enhanced internal stability without sacrificing its accuracy. Based on these algorithms we design a split-explicit hydrodynamic kernel for a realistic oceanic model, which addresses multiple numerical issues associated with mode splitting. This kernel utilizes consistent temporal averaging of the barotropic mode via a specially designed filter function to guarantee both exact conservation and constancy preservation properties for tracers and yields more accurate (up to second-order), resolved barotropic processes, while preventing aliasing of unresolved barotropic signals into the slow baroclinic motions. It has a more accurate mode-splitting due to redefined barotropic pressure-gradient terms to account for the local variations in density field, while maintaining the computational efficiency of a split model. It is naturally compatible with a variety of centered and upstream-biased high-order advection algorithms, and helps to mitigate computational cost of expensive physical parameterization of mixing processes and submodels.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a numerical model of sedimentary early diagenetic processes that includes oxic and anoxic mineralization. The model belongs to the new wave of early diagenesis models that account for depth-dependent bioturbation and porosity profiles; it can be used both for calculating steady-state conditions and transient simulation. It was developed to reproduce the cycling of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen along the ocean margin; it resolves the sediment-depth profiles of carbon, oxygen, nitrate, ammonium, and other reduced substances. Organic carbon is modeled as two degradable fractions with different first-order degradation rates and nitrogen:carbon ratios, to account for the decreasing reactivity and N/C ratio of the organic matter with depth into the sediment. The consumption of oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors is explicitly modeled, and mineralization is limited both by carbon (first order kinetics) and by oxidant availability (Michaelis-Menten type kinetics). Nitrification and oxic mineralization are decoupled, which allows the description of ammonium profiles. Mineralization processes using other oxidants (manganese oxides, iron oxides, sulphate) are lumped into one process, where degradation is only carbon limited; the terminal electron acceptors are not explicitly modeled, only the production of reduced substances is described. These substances are in part permanently removed (e.g., pyrite formation below the bioturbation zone) and partly diffuse towards the oxic layer where they react with oxygen. The values of several parameters were constrained using literature-derived relationships. The model was calibrated on a dataset obtained from the literature, which relates the magnitude of the different pathways to total organic carbon mineralization. The influence of carbon flux, bioturbation, sedimentation rate, bottomwater concentrations of oxygen, and nitrate and carbon degradability on the different mineralization pathways is examined. The relative contribution of the oxic mineralization in the model is significantly depressed under high organic flux, under low bottomwater oxygen conditions and when the bioturbation increases; higher carbon degradability has only a small positive effect, while sedimentation rate is relatively unimportant. Denitrification is mainly influenced by the nitrate concentration in the overlying bottomwater.},

  Abstract                 = {A new ecosystem model – the Ecological Connectivity Hypoxia Model (ECOHYM) – was developed and applied to Tokyo Bay, a hypoxic estuary in Japan. \{ECOHYM\} permits study of the dynamics and mechanisms of hypoxia from two perspectives: (1) the whole estuary, composed of temporal-spatial mutual linkage of benthic–pelagic or central bay-tidal flat ecosystems (holistic approach), and (2) each biochemical and physical process, contributing to oxygen production/consumption (elemental approach). \{ECOHYM\} evaluates the oxygen–carbon–nitrogen–phosphorus-coupled cycle driven by physical and biochemical processes. The processes mechanically describe the ecosystem network consisting of benthic–pelagic and central bay–tidal flat ecosystem coupling. The model also describes the early diagenetic processes of the benthic ecosystems by setting a micro-scale vertical spatial resolution due to the drastic vertical change of benthic biological metabolism and its high contribution to total oxygen consumption. Model variables were mainly selected based on low trophic level; namely, phytoplankton, zooplankton, detritus, dissolved organic matter, NH4–N, NO3–N, PO4–P, benthic algae, suspension feeders, deposit feeders (benthic faunas), dissolved oxygen (DO) and oxygen demand units (ODU, representing the stoichiometric expression of Mn2+, Fe2+ and S2− oxygen demand). Detritus was divided into fast-labile, slow-labile and refractory parts. Bacterial mineralization processes were divided into oxic, suboxic and anoxic fractions. The model was applied for a time frame of 100 years under seasonal forcing functions to achieve an annual periodical steady state. The model results revealed that the seasonal dynamics were more noticeable than the daily/tidal dynamics in the central bay area. In contrast, the daily/tidal dynamics were determinant in the tidal flat area. Calculated seasonal dynamics in the central bay and daily/tidal dynamics in the tidal flat were in good agreement with the observed data. In particular, the model succeeded in reproducing the following vertical \{DO\} profiles during the hypoxic season (summer): (1) high oxygen at the sea-surface and hypoxia at the sea-bottom in the central bay area, (2) the reduced thickness of the benthic oxic layer in the central bay area, and (3) the drastic change of \{DO\} micro-profiles between daytime and nighttime of the benthic system in the tidal flat areas. Oxygen fluxes at the sediment–water interface in the model also reproduced the in situ observed values both in the central bay and tidal flat areas. },

  Abstract                 = {Sea ice is a fundamental component of the climate system and plays a key role in polar trophic food webs. Nonetheless sea ice biogeochemical dynamics at large temporal and spatial scales are still rarely described. Numerical models may potentially contribute integrating among sparse observations, but available models of sea ice biogeochemistry are still scarce, whether their relevance for properly describing the current and future state of the polar oceans has been recently addressed. A general methodology to develop a sea ice biogeochemical model is presented, deriving it from an existing validated model application by extension of generic pelagic biogeochemistry model parameterizations. The described methodology is flexible and considers different levels of ecosystem complexity and vertical representation, while adopting a strategy of coupling that ensures mass conservation. We show how to apply this methodology step by step by building an intermediate complexity model from a published realistic application and applying it to analyze theoretically a typical season of first-year sea ice in the Arctic, the one currently needing the most urgent understanding. The aim is to (1) introduce sea ice biogeochemistry and address its relevance to ocean modelers of polar regions, supporting them in adding a new sea ice component to their modelling framework for a more adequate representation of the sea ice-covered ocean ecosystem as a whole, and (2) extend our knowledge on the relevant controlling factors of sea ice algal production, showing that beyond the light and nutrient availability, the duration of the sea ice season may play a key-role shaping the algal production during the on going and upcoming projected changes.},

A simple but comprehensive physical model of the sea ice thermo-halodynamics is coupled to a novel sea ice microalgal model of growth in the framework of the Biogeochemical Flux Model. The physical model provides the key physical properties of the Biologically Active Layer and the biological model simulates the physiological and ecological response of the algal community to the physical environment. Numerical simulations of chl-a were compared with observations at two different ice stations, in the Baltic and off the coast of Greenland, showing that this new coupling structure is sufficiently generic to represent well the temporal and spatial distribution of sea ice algae during the whole ice season at both sites. This model implementation and coupling structure is viable as a new component of General Circulation Models, allowing for estimates of the role and importance of sea ice biology in the local and global carbon cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {Sea ice ecosystems are characterized by microalgae living in brine inclusions. The growth rate of ice algae depends on light and nutrient supply. Here, the interactions between nutrients and brine dynamics under the influence of algae are investigated using a one-dimensional model. The model includes snow and ice thermodynamics with brine physics and an idealized sea ice biological component, characterized by one nutrient, namely, dissolved silica (DSi). In the model, DSi follows brine motion and is consumed by ice algae. Depending on physical ice characteristics, the brine flow is either advective, diffusive, or turbulent. The vertical profiles of ice salinity and DSi concentration are solutions of advection-diffusion equations. The model is configured to simulate the typical thermodynamic regimes of first-year Antarctic pack ice. The simulated vertical profiles of salinity and DSi qualitatively reproduce observations. Analysis of results highlights the role of convection in the lowermost 5–10 cm of ice. Convection mixes saline, nutrient-poor brine with comparatively fresh, nutrient-rich seawater. This implies a rejection of salt to the ocean and a flux of DSi to the ice. In the presence of growing algae, the simulated ocean-to-ice DSi flux increases by 0–115% compared to an abiotic situation. In turn, primary production and brine convection act in synergy to form a nutrient pump. The other important processes are the flooding of the surface by seawater and the percolation of meltwater. The former refills nutrients near the ice surface in spring. The latter, if present, tends to expell nutrients from the ice in summer.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a global ocean implementation of a multi-component model of marine pelagic biogeochemistry coupled on-line with an ocean general circulation model forced with climatological surface fields (PELAgic biogeochemistry for Global Ocean Simulations, PELAGOS). The final objective is the inclusion of this model as a component in an Earth System model for climate studies. The pelagic model is based on a functional stoichiometric representation of marine biogeochemical cycles and allows simulating the dynamics of C, N, P, Si, O and Fe taking into account the variation of their elemental ratios in the functional groups. The model also includes a parameterization of variable chlorophyll/carbon ratio in phytoplankton, carrying chl as a prognostic variable. The first part of the paper analyzes the contribution of non-local advective–diffusive terms and local vertical processes to the simulated chl distributions. The comparison of the three experiments shows that the mean chl distribution at higher latitudes is largely determined by mixing processes, while vertical advection controls the distribution in the equatorial upwelling regions. Horizontal advective and diffusive processes are necessary mechanisms for the shape of chl distribution in the sub-tropical Pacific. In the second part, the results have been compared with existing datasets of satellite-derived chlorophyll, surface nutrients, estimates of phytoplankton community composition and primary production data. The agreement is reasonable both in terms of the spatial distribution of annual means and of the seasonal variability in different dynamical oceanographic regions. Results indicate that some of the model biases in chl and surface nutrients distributions can be related to deficiencies in the simulation of physical processes such as advection and mixing. Other discrepancies are attributed to inadequate parameterizations of phytoplankton functional groups. The model has skill in reproducing the overall distribution of large and small phytoplankton but tends to underestimate diatoms in the northern higher latitudes and overestimate nanophytoplankton with respect to picoautotrophs in oligotrophic regions. The performance of the model is discussed in the context of its use in climate studies and an approach for improving the parameterization of functional groups in deterministic models is outlined.},

The fundamental approach stems from the representation of marine trophic interactions and major biogeochemical cycles introduced in the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM). Our theoretical formulation revisits and generalizes the stoichiometric approach of \{ERSEM\} by defining the state variables as Chemical Functional Families (CFF). \{CFFs\} are further subdivided into living, non-living and inorganic components. Living \{CFFs\} are the basis for the definition of Living Functional Groups, the biomass-based functional prototype of the real organisms. Both \{CFFs\} and \{LFGs\} are theoretical constructs which allow us to relate measurable properties of marine biogeochemistry to the state variables used in deterministic models. This approach is sufficiently generic that may be used to describe other existing biomass-based ecosystem model.},

  Abstract                 = {Substantial increase in atmospheric temperature has been observed over the Siberian Arctic during the last decades, likely a manifestation of climate change as a result of amplified concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This has raised questions about possible feedbacks to the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by processes acting in the ocean and the river drainage basins. Addressing these questions, simulations with different forcings have been performed utilizing a one-dimensional, time‐dependent coupled physical–biogeochemical model that has been optimized for the carbon system in the Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean. The forcings applied are: increased air temperature, wind or river discharge; increased concentration of dissolved organic carbon or nutrients in river runoff; increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or the runoff as well as a combination of five of these forcings. The model simulations reveal a net outgassing of \{CO2\} from the ocean to the atmosphere when the dissolved organic carbon and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in river runoff are doubled. However, an increase in the ocean's ability to take up carbon dioxide occurs if concentration of nutrients in the runoff increases, which is a result of increased primary productivity. The ocean also acts as a stronger sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide when increasing the air temperature, wind speed or the atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide. To reflect the conditions at the end of this century a simulation with changes of several forcing parameters was performed, i.e. with doubled atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 4 °C temperature increase in the air, doubling the runoff dissolved organic carbon concentration, increasing the river discharge by 25% and increasing the wind speed by 10%. This simulation increased the uptake of the ocean by more than five times, from − 0.9 (± 0.3) to − 4.6 (± 1.3) mol C m− 2 y− 1. The main effect is due to the doubling of partial pressure of carbon dioxide. In a model simulation without the increased atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide, the \{CO2\} uptake decreased by 0.2 mol C m− 2 y− 1 to − 0.7 (± 0.6) mol C m− 2 y− 1.},

  Abstract                 = {Global temperature observations during the last century show that the largest increase over the last decades has been manifested in the Arctic, particularly within the Siberian region. The Arctic Ocean is a harsh region with few field studies, resulting in limited temporal and spatial resolution of hydrographical data. One way to circumvent this deficit is to utilise a model that represents processes which are known to possibly impact climate. This has been done for the carbon system in the Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean by utilising a one-dimensional, time dependent coupled physical–biochemical model. This model was validated by observational data of temperature, salinity, phosphate, oxygen and the carbon system. The model simulation reveals that wind pattern is essential for the exchange of dissolved inorganic carbon with the surrounding seas and the carbon dioxide exchange with the atmosphere. The latter is largely driven by the surface water partial pressure of carbon dioxide that is impacted by primary production, water temperature, vertical mixing and river runoff. The model shows that the timing of these factors is critical for the flux of carbon dioxide as is the sea ice coverage. Modelled primary production starts after the disappearance of sea ice and the spring flood has reached the area in June, it peaks in a short time and decreases slowly to negligible levels in mid September. This primary production causes an undersaturation of carbon dioxide with up to 200 μatm during the productive season after which the partial pressure of carbon dioxide increases as the carbon dioxide rich deep water mixes up into the surface layer. However, surface water partial pressure of carbon dioxide is undersaturated all through the year, except for some years when there is a short period of outgasing in the beginning of June. This outgasing occurs when the ice breaks up late and river runoff accumulates under the ice.},

  note     = {Sea Ice in the Paleoclimate System: the Challenge of Reconstructing Sea Ice from Proxies},
  abstract = {Observations from the last decade suggest an important role of sea ice in the global biogeochemical cycles, promoted by (i) active biological and chemical processes within the sea ice; (ii) fluid and gas exchanges at the sea ice interface through an often permeable sea ice cover; and (iii) tight physical, biological and chemical interactions between the sea ice, the ocean and the atmosphere. Photosynthetic micro-organisms in sea ice thrive in liquid brine inclusions encased in a pure ice matrix, where they find suitable light and nutrient levels. They extend the production season, provide a winter and early spring food source, and contribute to organic carbon export to depth. Under-ice and ice edge phytoplankton blooms occur when ice retreats, favoured by increasing light, stratification, and by the release of material into the water column. In particular, the release of iron – highly concentrated in sea ice – could have large effects in the iron-limited Southern Ocean. The export of inorganic carbon transport by brine sinking below the mixed layer, calcium carbonate precipitation in sea ice, as well as active ice-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes, could play a central role in the marine carbon cycle. Sea ice processes could also significantly contribute to the sulphur cycle through the large production by ice algae of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), the precursor of sulphate aerosols, which as cloud condensation nuclei have a potential cooling effect on the planet. Finally, the sea ice zone supports significant ocean–atmosphere methane (CH4) fluxes, while saline ice surfaces activate springtime atmospheric bromine chemistry, setting ground for tropospheric ozone depletion events observed near both poles. All these mechanisms are generally known, but neither precisely understood nor quantified at large scales. As polar regions are rapidly changing, understanding the large-scale polar marine biogeochemical processes and their future evolution is of high priority. Earth system models should in this context prove essential, but they currently represent sea ice as biologically and chemically inert. Palaeoclimatic proxies are also relevant, in particular the sea ice proxies, inferring past sea ice conditions from glacial and marine sediment core records and providing analogues for future changes. Being highly constrained by marine biogeochemistry, sea ice proxies would not only contribute to but also benefit from a better understanding of polar marine biogeochemical cycles.},

  abstract  = {Oceanic anthropogenic CO2 uptake will decrease both the pH and the aragonite saturation state (Ωarag) of seawater leading to an oceanic acidification. However, the factors controlling future changes in pH and Ωarag are independent and will respond differently to oceanic climate change feedbacks such as ocean warming, circulation and biological changes. We examine the sensitivity of these two CO2-related parameters to climate change feedbacks within a coupled atmosphere-ocean model. The ocean warming feedback was found to dominate the climate change responses in the surface ocean. Although surface pH is projected to decrease relatively uniformly by about 0.3 by the year 2100, we find pH to be insensitive to climate change feedbacks, whereas Ωarag is buffered by ∼15%. Ocean carbonate chemistry creates a situation whereby the direct pH changes due to ocean warming are almost cancelled by the pH changes associated with dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations changes via a reduction in CO2 solubility from ocean warming. We show that the small climate change feedback on future surface ocean pH is independent to the amount of ocean warming. Our analysis therefore implies that future projections of surface ocean acidification only need to consider future atmospheric CO2 levels, not climate change induced modifications in the ocean.},

  abstract = {The seasonal dynamics of pelagic and sea ice communities are closely related in ice-covered waters, however, modelling works that analyse such interactions are scarce. We use the Biogeochemical Flux Model in Sea Ice (BFM-SI) coupled to the pelagic Biogeochemical Flux Model (BFM) in a study area in Greenland to quantitatively investigate: (1) the significance of photoacclimation/photoadaptation strategies of autotrophs, (2) the fate of the sea ice biomass in case of algae seeding, algae aggregation and at different mixed layer depths and (3) the changes in community production under a climate change scenario. The results show that sea ice algae need to be both photoacclimated and photoadapted to the sea ice environment in order to grow, while phytoplankton may adopt different strategies for optimising their growth. The seeding of the phytoplankton bloom shows to be driven, both in timing and magnitude, by the viability of sea ice algae and by the degree of aggregation of algae released from the ice, which also affects the sinking rate to the sea floor. Under a mild climate change scenario (SRES B2, 2071–2090) the sea ice community is projected to be generally more productive, whereas phytoplankton growth will be reduced because the melt of sea ice will occur earlier in the season when light is less favourable to sustain the growth. While it is generally anticipated that the melting of multi-year ice in the Arctic Ocean will cause an increase in marine production, this study shows that seasonal ice-covered seas in the Northern hemisphere may actually be less productive and may shift to more oligotrophic conditions within the next 100 years.},

In particular, the magnitude, spatial distribution, and seasonality of the surface warming in the Arctic is examined and compared among the models. The range of simulated polar warming in the Arctic is from 1.5 to 4.5 times the global mean warming. While ice-albedo feedback is likely to account for much of the polar amplification, the strength of the feedback depends on numerous physical processes and parametrizations which differ considerably among the models. Nonetheless, the mean sea-ice state in the control (or present) climate is found to influence both the magnitude and spatial distribution of the high-latitude warming in the models. In particular, the latitude of the maximum warming is correlated inversely and significantly with sea-ice extent in the control climate. Additionally, models with relatively thin Arctic ice cover in the control climate tend to have higher polar amplification. An intercomparison of model results also shows that increases in poleward ocean heat transport at high latitudes and increases in polar cloud cover are significantly correlated to amplified Arctic warming. This suggests that these changes in the climate state may modify polar amplification. No significant correlation is found between polar amplification and the control climate continental ice and snow cover.},

  abstract = {Large gradients of dissolved silica are common in the uppermost layers of abyssal marine sediments. These gradients can be sustained only by an active, continuous supply of dissolved silica from within the sediments. The flux of dissolved silica is approximately equivalent to the total accumulation rate of all siliceous material (including aluminosilicates) in the sediments; if aluminosilicates were the source of dissolved silica they would have to give up nearly all of their silicon. Since marine sediments commonly show no such depletion in silicon with depth, dissolution of aluminosilicates cannot be the primary source of dissolved silica emanating from the sea floor. The main source of this flux must be particulate biogenous silica that is mixed downward into the more inert sedimentary material and dissolves leaving little residue. Biological and physical processes stir deep-sea sediments at rates which can be described by vertical mixing coefficients. These coefficients can be evaluated from microtektite redistribution or from the depth profiles of plutonium in sediments. Measured rates range between 0.5 and 400 cm2 kyr−1 in the deep sea. By redistributing reactive particles, this vertical mixing influences the chemical gradients in interstitial waters and the chemical fluxes across the sea-floor boundary. Dissolving particles of silica or calcium carbonate will have more effect on pore water concentrations when they are deeper within the sediment. Model calculations show the input flux of biogenous particulate silica to be the primary controlling factor on the flux of dissolved silica and on the interstitial profile of dissolved silica. Bioturbation rates and dissolution rates also have an important effect on interstitial profiles and this effect can be estimated although the actual rates are poorly known. Model calculations indicate that the concentrations of dissolved species in pore water are controlled by a dynamic balance between competing processes. Equilibrium reactions between sediments in the upper few meters of the sediment column and their associated pore water are almost irrelevant in establishing the composition of the pore waters. Silica solubility is only slightly affected by temperature and pressure changes in the deep sea, and abyssal waters are always far from saturation. Accordingly the water composition can have only a minimal effect on dissolution rates of SiO2. On the other hand, the actual mechanism which prevents dissolution of some siliceous fossils remains unknown. A stagnant boundary layer in water overlying the sea floor will have almost no effect on concentrations or fluxes of silica. Variations in bioturbation rates or in the flux of biogenous particulate silica to the sediment would affect the balance of concentrations in the pore water profile. Such changes over the last few hundred years would be recorded in the composition of pore waters which are associated with sedimentary particles hundreds of thousands of years old. In this sense the “age” of the pore waters is far less than the “age” of the associated solids in the upper meters of the sea floor.},

  abstract  = {At maximum extent the sea ice covers some 8{\%} of the Southern Hemisphere and 5{\%} of the Northern Hemisphere and thus has a significant influence on the productivity of large ocean areas. The structure, extent and distribution of sea ice not only influences biogenic production within the ice system, but also affects pelagic and benthic systems under the ice and near ice edges. The sea ice in Polar Oceans provides a unique environment utilised by a diverse group of organisms ranging in size from single-celled algae within the ice to meter-long algal assemblages, dominated by diatoms, attached to the lower surface of the ice, and from protozoans to marine mammals. Sea ice (sympagic) biota play an important role in high Arctic food webs. Ice algae may serve as an inocculum for marginal ice zone blooms and form the base of food webs culminating in polar cod (L{\o}nne and Gulliksen 1989), seals (Nilssen et al. 1995) and seabirds (L{\o}nne and Gabrielsen 1992). Matter entering this lipid-rich food web may reach higher trophic levels in areas geographically distant from its place of origin, due to passive transport of sea ice biota in Arctic ice drift (Falk-Petersen et al. 1990},

  abstract = {We have developed a coupled snow-ice–ice algae model to investigate the importance of different ice algal growth limitation terms, as well as different loss terms, in regulating the ice algal biomass accumulation at the bottom of landfast ice in the Canadian Archipelago. The model results are compared with data collected from May to July 2002 at a station near Resolute in Barrow Strait. Our results show that ice algae are light limited at the beginning of the bloom, then fluctuate between light and nutrient limitation, finally remaining nutrient limited toward the end of the bloom. The fortnightly tide modulates the ice algal biomass through the supply of nutrient to the ice algal layer but mainly through modulation of the bottom ice melt rate. We also demonstrate that the bottom ice melt rate regulates the maximum biomass attained in the region and that a rapid increase in ice temperature can lead to a significant decline in ice algal biomass. The eventual termination of the bloom is triggered by melting of the snow cover and results from (1) increased ice algal losses due to high bottom ice melt rate and (2) decreased ice algal growth due to nutrient limitation caused by the formation of a meltwater lens below the ice. Finally, our results show that the snow cover controls the length of the bloom, such that earlier snowmelt that is expected to accompany climate warming may lead to a reduction in ice algal production.},
