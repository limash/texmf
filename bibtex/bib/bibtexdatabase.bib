  abstract = {Abstract One of the most of challenging steps in the development of coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical models is the combination of multiple, often incompatible computer codes that describe individual physical, chemical, biological and geological processes. This “coupling” is time-consuming, error-prone, and demanding in terms of scientific and programming expertise. The open source, Fortran-based Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models addresses these problems by providing a consistent set of programming interfaces through which hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models communicate. Models are coded once to connect to FABM, after which arbitrary combinations of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models can be made. Thus, a biogeochemical model code works unmodified within models of a chemostat, a vertically structured water column, and a three-dimensional basin. Moreover, complex biogeochemistry can be distributed over many compact, self-contained modules, coupled at run-time. By enabling distributed development and user-controlled coupling of biogeochemical models, \{FABM\} enables optimal use of the expertise of scientists, programmers and end-users.},

The fundamental approach stems from the representation of marine trophic interactions and major biogeochemical cycles introduced in the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM). Our theoretical formulation revisits and generalizes the stoichiometric approach of \{ERSEM\} by defining the state variables as Chemical Functional Families (CFF). \{CFFs\} are further subdivided into living, non-living and inorganic components. Living \{CFFs\} are the basis for the definition of Living Functional Groups, the biomass-based functional prototype of the real organisms. Both \{CFFs\} and \{LFGs\} are theoretical constructs which allow us to relate measurable properties of marine biogeochemistry to the state variables used in deterministic models. This approach is sufficiently generic that may be used to describe other existing biomass-based ecosystem model.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a global ocean implementation of a multi-component model of marine pelagic biogeochemistry coupled on-line with an ocean general circulation model forced with climatological surface fields (PELAgic biogeochemistry for Global Ocean Simulations, PELAGOS). The final objective is the inclusion of this model as a component in an Earth System model for climate studies. The pelagic model is based on a functional stoichiometric representation of marine biogeochemical cycles and allows simulating the dynamics of C, N, P, Si, O and Fe taking into account the variation of their elemental ratios in the functional groups. The model also includes a parameterization of variable chlorophyll/carbon ratio in phytoplankton, carrying chl as a prognostic variable. The first part of the paper analyzes the contribution of non-local advective–diffusive terms and local vertical processes to the simulated chl distributions. The comparison of the three experiments shows that the mean chl distribution at higher latitudes is largely determined by mixing processes, while vertical advection controls the distribution in the equatorial upwelling regions. Horizontal advective and diffusive processes are necessary mechanisms for the shape of chl distribution in the sub-tropical Pacific. In the second part, the results have been compared with existing datasets of satellite-derived chlorophyll, surface nutrients, estimates of phytoplankton community composition and primary production data. The agreement is reasonable both in terms of the spatial distribution of annual means and of the seasonal variability in different dynamical oceanographic regions. Results indicate that some of the model biases in chl and surface nutrients distributions can be related to deficiencies in the simulation of physical processes such as advection and mixing. Other discrepancies are attributed to inadequate parameterizations of phytoplankton functional groups. The model has skill in reproducing the overall distribution of large and small phytoplankton but tends to underestimate diatoms in the northern higher latitudes and overestimate nanophytoplankton with respect to picoautotrophs in oligotrophic regions. The performance of the model is discussed in the context of its use in climate studies and an approach for improving the parameterization of functional groups in deterministic models is outlined.},

  abstract = {A coupled carbonate system–marine ecosystem–hydrodynamic model is used to simulate the temporal and spatial variability in pH across the southern North Sea as it relates to the environmental and biological processes affecting CO2, namely, photosynthesis and respiration, riverine boundary conditions and atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations. Annual pH ranges are found to vary from &lt; 0.2 in areas of low biological activity to &gt; 1.0 in areas influenced by riverine signals, consistent with observations and previous studies. It is shown that benthic, as well as pelagic, activity is an important factor in this variability. The acidification of the region due to increased fluxes of atmospheric \{CO2\} into the marine system is calculated and shown to exceed, on average, 0.1 pH units over the next 50 years and result in a total acidification of 0.5 pH units below pre-industrial levels at atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations of 1000 ppm. The potential for measurable changes in biogeochemistry are demonstrated by simulating the observed inhibition of pelagic nitrification with decreasing pH. However, we conclude that there is a lack of knowledge of how acidification might affect the complex interaction of processes that govern marine biogeochemical cycles and a consequent need for further research and observations.},

abstract = "A new ecosystem model – the Ecological Connectivity Hypoxia Model (ECOHYM) – was developed and applied to Tokyo Bay, a hypoxic estuary in Japan. \{ECOHYM\} permits study of the dynamics and mechanisms of hypoxia from two perspectives: (1) the whole estuary, composed of temporal-spatial mutual linkage of benthic–pelagic or central bay-tidal flat ecosystems (holistic approach), and (2) each biochemical and physical process, contributing to oxygen production/consumption (elemental approach). \{ECOHYM\} evaluates the oxygen–carbon–nitrogen–phosphorus-coupled cycle driven by physical and biochemical processes. The processes mechanically describe the ecosystem network consisting of benthic–pelagic and central bay–tidal flat ecosystem coupling. The model also describes the early diagenetic processes of the benthic ecosystems by setting a micro-scale vertical spatial resolution due to the drastic vertical change of benthic biological metabolism and its high contribution to total oxygen consumption. Model variables were mainly selected based on low trophic level; namely, phytoplankton, zooplankton, detritus, dissolved organic matter, NH4–N, NO3–N, PO4–P, benthic algae, suspension feeders, deposit feeders (benthic faunas), dissolved oxygen (DO) and oxygen demand units (ODU, representing the stoichiometric expression of Mn2+, Fe2+ and S2− oxygen demand). Detritus was divided into fast-labile, slow-labile and refractory parts. Bacterial mineralization processes were divided into oxic, suboxic and anoxic fractions. The model was applied for a time frame of 100 years under seasonal forcing functions to achieve an annual periodical steady state. The model results revealed that the seasonal dynamics were more noticeable than the daily/tidal dynamics in the central bay area. In contrast, the daily/tidal dynamics were determinant in the tidal flat area. Calculated seasonal dynamics in the central bay and daily/tidal dynamics in the tidal flat were in good agreement with the observed data. In particular, the model succeeded in reproducing the following vertical \{DO\} profiles during the hypoxic season (summer): (1) high oxygen at the sea-surface and hypoxia at the sea-bottom in the central bay area, (2) the reduced thickness of the benthic oxic layer in the central bay area, and (3) the drastic change of \{DO\} micro-profiles between daytime and nighttime of the benthic system in the tidal flat areas. Oxygen fluxes at the sediment–water interface in the model also reproduced the in situ observed values both in the central bay and tidal flat areas. "

  abstract = {Global temperature observations during the last century show that the largest increase over the last decades has been manifested in the Arctic, particularly within the Siberian region. The Arctic Ocean is a harsh region with few field studies, resulting in limited temporal and spatial resolution of hydrographical data. One way to circumvent this deficit is to utilise a model that represents processes which are known to possibly impact climate. This has been done for the carbon system in the Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean by utilising a one-dimensional, time dependent coupled physical–biochemical model. This model was validated by observational data of temperature, salinity, phosphate, oxygen and the carbon system. The model simulation reveals that wind pattern is essential for the exchange of dissolved inorganic carbon with the surrounding seas and the carbon dioxide exchange with the atmosphere. The latter is largely driven by the surface water partial pressure of carbon dioxide that is impacted by primary production, water temperature, vertical mixing and river runoff. The model shows that the timing of these factors is critical for the flux of carbon dioxide as is the sea ice coverage. Modelled primary production starts after the disappearance of sea ice and the spring flood has reached the area in June, it peaks in a short time and decreases slowly to negligible levels in mid September. This primary production causes an undersaturation of carbon dioxide with up to 200 μatm during the productive season after which the partial pressure of carbon dioxide increases as the carbon dioxide rich deep water mixes up into the surface layer. However, surface water partial pressure of carbon dioxide is undersaturated all through the year, except for some years when there is a short period of outgasing in the beginning of June. This outgasing occurs when the ice breaks up late and river runoff accumulates under the ice.},

  abstract = {Substantial increase in atmospheric temperature has been observed over the Siberian Arctic during the last decades, likely a manifestation of climate change as a result of amplified concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This has raised questions about possible feedbacks to the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by processes acting in the ocean and the river drainage basins. Addressing these questions, simulations with different forcings have been performed utilizing a one-dimensional, time‐dependent coupled physical–biogeochemical model that has been optimized for the carbon system in the Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean. The forcings applied are: increased air temperature, wind or river discharge; increased concentration of dissolved organic carbon or nutrients in river runoff; increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or the runoff as well as a combination of five of these forcings. The model simulations reveal a net outgassing of \{CO2\} from the ocean to the atmosphere when the dissolved organic carbon and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in river runoff are doubled. However, an increase in the ocean's ability to take up carbon dioxide occurs if concentration of nutrients in the runoff increases, which is a result of increased primary productivity. The ocean also acts as a stronger sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide when increasing the air temperature, wind speed or the atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide. To reflect the conditions at the end of this century a simulation with changes of several forcing parameters was performed, i.e. with doubled atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 4 °C temperature increase in the air, doubling the runoff dissolved organic carbon concentration, increasing the river discharge by 25% and increasing the wind speed by 10%. This simulation increased the uptake of the ocean by more than five times, from − 0.9 (± 0.3) to − 4.6 (± 1.3) mol C m− 2 y− 1. The main effect is due to the doubling of partial pressure of carbon dioxide. In a model simulation without the increased atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide, the \{CO2\} uptake decreased by 0.2 mol C m− 2 y− 1 to − 0.7 (± 0.6) mol C m− 2 y− 1.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this study an ice-algal mathematical model is used to resolve the vertical fine structure of sea ice with ice algae, and results are compared to simulations with ice algae located only at the bottom ice layer and to those where ice algae are distributed homogeneously across part of the ice column. Ice algae are reported to contribute 4–26% of overall Arctic Ocean primary production and are an important food source for the ice-associated ecosystem. Thus, it is important to estimate the future impacts of global warming on the contribution of ice algae to Arctic primary production. Primary production models, describing the relationships between ice-algal physiology and population dynamics, with environmental forcing and trophic interactions involving bacteria and grazers, can be applied to quantify such impacts. One important aspect in these models is how to represent the vertical distribution of ice algae in sea ice. In most models, only the bottom ice layer is considered where most of the algal biomass tends to be concentrated. However, since ice algae are also present along the entire ice column, this may lead to underestimation of ice-algal production. Some empirical data and model results suggest that ice algae located in the surface and interior layers may be kept at lower concentrations, in spite of high growth rates, due to grazing by micro- and meiofauna. Results obtained in this study show the importance of resolving vertically the distribution of ice algae to avoid bias in primary production estimates, well in line with empirical studies. },

  abstract = {In the Arctic Ocean, both phytoplankton and sea ice algae are important contributors to primary production and the arctic food web. An ice algal ecosystem model was added to fully couple with the global physical model POP-CICE (Parallel Ocean Program-Los Alamos Sea Ice Model) and the open-ocean pelagic ecosystem model. The physical model captured the seasonal and interannual variations of northern hemispheric sea ice extent and area measured by satellite remote sensing for the model period of 1992–2007. The model results showed a reasonable mean seasonal cycle of ice algal production from March to May and subsequent ocean production from May to September in the Arctic. The ice algal production, although smaller than that of the ocean, is of ecological importance as a food source for higher trophic levels during the long arctic winter before ice melt. The simulated mean open-ocean upper 100 m primary production within the Arctic Circle was 413±88 T g C yr−1 in the years 1998–2006, close to the remote sensing derived estimate of 419±33 T g C yr−1 but with higher interannual variations. The mean sea ice algal production in the Northern Hemisphere from 1998 to 2007 was 21.3 T g C yr−1, which is in the range of multi-observational estimations of 9–73 T g C yr−1 based on in situ measurements. Model-data comparisons were conducted with various regional observations and the observed trend of temporal and spatial variation of the primary production. The model results compared well with the following observations and observed trends: (1) an increase of ocean primary production from 2003 to 2007 in the arctic open water areas as derived from remote sensing data; (2) regional annual ice and ocean primary production measured in the Bering and Chukchi seas and Canadian Basin; (3) primary production rate with phytoplankton size composition and Chl-a concentration along an arctic cruise track in the Chukchi Sea and Canadian Basin from August 2 to September 7, 2008; and (4) observed decadal changes of ocean primary production from the 1990s to 2007 due to rising temperature and increasing open-ocean area in the western Arctic. The changes are shown as a trend of a northward shift of production, with a decrease in the Bering Sea and an increase in the Arctic shelf. },

Preliminary simulations indicate that, during a bloom, microalgae are able to maintain their vertical position relative to the lower congelation ice margin and are not incorporated into the crystal matrix as the ice sheet thickens.

A simple but comprehensive physical model of the sea ice thermo-halodynamics is coupled to a novel sea ice microalgal model of growth in the framework of the Biogeochemical Flux Model. The physical model provides the key physical properties of the Biologically Active Layer and the biological model simulates the physiological and ecological response of the algal community to the physical environment. Numerical simulations of chl-a were compared with observations at two different ice stations, in the Baltic and off the coast of Greenland, showing that this new coupling structure is sufficiently generic to represent well the temporal and spatial distribution of sea ice algae during the whole ice season at both sites. This model implementation and coupling structure is viable as a new component of General Circulation Models, allowing for estimates of the role and importance of sea ice biology in the local and global carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {Sea ice ecosystems are characterized by microalgae living in brine inclusions. The growth rate of ice algae depends on light and nutrient supply. Here, the interactions between nutrients and brine dynamics under the influence of algae are investigated using a one-dimensional model. The model includes snow and ice thermodynamics with brine physics and an idealized sea ice biological component, characterized by one nutrient, namely, dissolved silica (DSi). In the model, DSi follows brine motion and is consumed by ice algae. Depending on physical ice characteristics, the brine flow is either advective, diffusive, or turbulent. The vertical profiles of ice salinity and DSi concentration are solutions of advection-diffusion equations. The model is configured to simulate the typical thermodynamic regimes of first-year Antarctic pack ice. The simulated vertical profiles of salinity and DSi qualitatively reproduce observations. Analysis of results highlights the role of convection in the lowermost 5–10 cm of ice. Convection mixes saline, nutrient-poor brine with comparatively fresh, nutrient-rich seawater. This implies a rejection of salt to the ocean and a flux of DSi to the ice. In the presence of growing algae, the simulated ocean-to-ice DSi flux increases by 0–115% compared to an abiotic situation. In turn, primary production and brine convection act in synergy to form a nutrient pump. The other important processes are the flooding of the surface by seawater and the percolation of meltwater.

  abstract  = {Sea ice is a fundamental component of the climate system and plays a key role in polar trophic food webs. Nonetheless sea ice biogeochemical dynamics at large temporal and spatial scales are still rarely described. Numerical models may potentially contribute integrating among sparse observations, but available models of sea ice biogeochemistry are still scarce, whether their relevance for properly describing the current and future state of the polar oceans has been recently addressed. A general methodology to develop a sea ice biogeochemical model is presented, deriving it from an existing validated model application by extension of generic pelagic biogeochemistry model parameterizations. The described methodology is flexible and considers different levels of ecosystem complexity and vertical representation, while adopting a strategy of coupling that ensures mass conservation. We show how to apply this methodology step by step by building an intermediate complexity model from a published realistic application and applying it to analyze theoretically a typical season of first-year sea ice in the Arctic, the one currently needing the most urgent understanding. The aim is to (1) introduce sea ice biogeochemistry and address its relevance to ocean modelers of polar regions, supporting them in adding a new sea ice component to their modelling framework for a more adequate representation of the sea ice-covered ocean ecosystem as a whole, and (2) extend our knowledge on the relevant controlling factors of sea ice algal production, showing that beyond the light and nutrient availability, the duration of the sea ice season may play a key-role shaping the algal production during the on going and upcoming projected changes.},

  abstract = {We present a numerical model of sedimentary early diagenetic processes that includes oxic and anoxic mineralization. The model belongs to the new wave of early diagenesis models that account for depth-dependent bioturbation and porosity profiles; it can be used both for calculating steady-state conditions and transient simulation. It was developed to reproduce the cycling of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen along the ocean margin; it resolves the sediment-depth profiles of carbon, oxygen, nitrate, ammonium, and other reduced substances. Organic carbon is modeled as two degradable fractions with different first-order degradation rates and nitrogen:carbon ratios, to account for the decreasing reactivity and N/C ratio of the organic matter with depth into the sediment. The consumption of oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors is explicitly modeled, and mineralization is limited both by carbon (first order kinetics) and by oxidant availability (Michaelis-Menten type kinetics). Nitrification and oxic mineralization are decoupled, which allows the description of ammonium profiles. Mineralization processes using other oxidants (manganese oxides, iron oxides, sulphate) are lumped into one process, where degradation is only carbon limited; the terminal electron acceptors are not explicitly modeled, only the production of reduced substances is described. These substances are in part permanently removed (e.g., pyrite formation below the bioturbation zone) and partly diffuse towards the oxic layer where they react with oxygen. The values of several parameters were constrained using literature-derived relationships. The model was calibrated on a dataset obtained from the literature, which relates the magnitude of the different pathways to total organic carbon mineralization. The influence of carbon flux, bioturbation, sedimentation rate, bottomwater concentrations of oxygen, and nitrate and carbon degradability on the different mineralization pathways is examined. The relative contribution of the oxic mineralization in the model is significantly depressed under high organic flux, under low bottomwater oxygen conditions and when the bioturbation increases; higher carbon degradability has only a small positive effect, while sedimentation rate is relatively unimportant. Denitrification is mainly influenced by the nitrate concentration in the overlying bottomwater.},
