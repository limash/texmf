  Abstract                 = {A 2D numerical ecosystem model of Antarctic land fast ice is developed to elucidate the primary production with the Antarctic sea ice zone. The physical component employs atmospheric data to simulate congelation ice growth, initial brine entrapment, desalination, and nutrient flux. The biological component is based on the concept of a maximum temperature-dependent algal growth rate which is reduced by limitations imposed from insufficient light or nutrients, as well as suboptimal salinity. Preliminary simulations indicate that, during a bloom, microalgae are able to maintain their vertical position relative to the lower congelation ice margin and are not incorporated into the crystal matrix as the ice sheet thickens. It is inferred that land fast sea ice contains numerous microhabitats that are functionally distinct based upon the unique set of processes that control microalgal growth and accumulation within each.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the concept, structure and implementation of the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM). The model dynamically simulates the biogeochemical seasonal cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon in the pelagic and benthic food webs of the North Sea, and is forced by irradiance, temperature and transport processes. The model has a coarse spatial resolution into ten boxes, the ICES boxes, of which the five deepest have been resolved into surface (0 to 30 m) and deep (30 m to bottom) boxes. At the open boundaries, time series are prescribed for dissolved and particulate nutrients. River loads of nutrients for the rivers discharging into the North Sea are prescribed at monthly intervals. A general circulation model has been used to aggregate the exchange volumes across the box boundaries into daily in- and outflows. From these, the horizontal transports of dissolved and suspended constituents are calculated. Vertical transport is in the form of sinking and sedimentation for particulates and in the form of turbulent diffusion for dissolved constituents. The physical model contains all information specific to the area to be modelled, whereas the biological/chemical submodels have been constructed not to be site-specific. The biological variables are represented as functional groups expressed in units of organic carbon and the chemical variables as the internal pools in the biological variables and as the dissolved inorganic pools in water and sediment, expressed in units of N, P and Si. The model runs in a software environment (SESAME) developed for enabling the development of large and complex models in a modular way by a consortium of institutes, each focusing on different. aspects of the ecosystem, translating these into modules within the model. With the exception of fish populations, where size- and age-structure are explicity represented, all the other biological components have been modelled as unstructured populations aggregated into functional groups. This approach is shown to be appropriate for taxa having short generation times in relation to the annual cycle and for taxa which do not span more than one trophic level during their lifetime.},

  abstract = {A coupled carbonate system–marine ecosystem–hydrodynamic model is used to simulate the temporal and spatial variability in pH across the southern North Sea as it relates to the environmental and biological processes affecting CO2, namely, photosynthesis and respiration, riverine boundary conditions and atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations. Annual pH ranges are found to vary from &lt; 0.2 in areas of low biological activity to &gt; 1.0 in areas influenced by riverine signals, consistent with observations and previous studies. It is shown that benthic, as well as pelagic, activity is an important factor in this variability. The acidification of the region due to increased fluxes of atmospheric \{CO2\} into the marine system is calculated and shown to exceed, on average, 0.1 pH units over the next 50 years and result in a total acidification of 0.5 pH units below pre-industrial levels at atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations of 1000 ppm. The potential for measurable changes in biogeochemistry are demonstrated by simulating the observed inhibition of pelagic nitrification with decreasing pH. However, we conclude that there is a lack of knowledge of how acidification might affect the complex interaction of processes that govern marine biogeochemical cycles and a consequent need for further research and observations.},

  abstract = {Abstract One of the most of challenging steps in the development of coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical models is the combination of multiple, often incompatible computer codes that describe individual physical, chemical, biological and geological processes. This “coupling” is time-consuming, error-prone, and demanding in terms of scientific and programming expertise. The open source, Fortran-based Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models addresses these problems by providing a consistent set of programming interfaces through which hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models communicate. Models are coded once to connect to FABM, after which arbitrary combinations of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models can be made. Thus, a biogeochemical model code works unmodified within models of a chemostat, a vertically structured water column, and a three-dimensional basin. Moreover, complex biogeochemistry can be distributed over many compact, self-contained modules, coupled at run-time. By enabling distributed development and user-controlled coupling of biogeochemical models, \{FABM\} enables optimal use of the expertise of scientists, programmers and end-users.},

  abstract = {A modelling system for coupled physical–biogeochemical simulations in the water column is presented here. The physical model component allows for a number of different statistical turbulence closure schemes, ranging from simple algebraic closures to two-equation turbulence models with algebraic second-moment closures. The biogeochemical module consists of models which are based on a number of state variables represented by their ensemble averaged concentrations. Specific biogeochemical models may range from simple \{NPZ\} (nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton) to complex ecosystem models. Recently developed modified Patankar solvers for ordinary differential equations allow for stable discretisations of the production and destruction terms guaranteeing conservative and non-negative solutions. The increased stability of these new solvers over explicit solvers is demonstrated for a plankton spring bloom simulation. The model system is applied to marine ecosystem dynamics the Northern North Sea and the Central Gotland Sea. Two different biogeochemical models are applied, a conservative nitrogen-based model to the North Sea, and a more complex model including an oxygen equation to the Baltic Sea, allowing for the reproduction of chemical processes under anoxic conditions. For both applications, earlier model results obtained with slightly different model setups could be basically reproduced. It became however clear that the choice for ecosystem model parameters such as maximum phytoplankton growth rates does strongly depend on the physical model parameters (such as turbulence closure models or external forcing).},

The combination of these components involves the implementation of a numerical coupling method, that performs the spatial–temporal integration of the combined system, introducing an additional source of error to the system (splitting error). In this article we demonstrate the sensitivity of a comparatively complex 1D hydrodynamical biogeochemical model to the coupling method, showing that for an inadequate choice of the coupling method, the splitting error may dominate the numerical error of the system. It is demonstrated that for this type of system the tracer transport time scale clearly dominates over the scale of the biogeochemical processes, that maybe computed on significantly coarser time scales. In between the implemented coupling schemes Operator Splitting and Source Splitting, the Source Splitting method inserting the biogeochemical rates into the transport tracer integration is to be preferred for these type of models.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this study an ice-algal mathematical model is used to resolve the vertical fine structure of sea ice with ice algae, and results are compared to simulations with ice algae located only at the bottom ice layer and to those where ice algae are distributed homogeneously across part of the ice column. Ice algae are reported to contribute 4–26% of overall Arctic Ocean primary production and are an important food source for the ice-associated ecosystem. Thus, it is important to estimate the future impacts of global warming on the contribution of ice algae to Arctic primary production. Primary production models, describing the relationships between ice-algal physiology and population dynamics, with environmental forcing and trophic interactions involving bacteria and grazers, can be applied to quantify such impacts. One important aspect in these models is how to represent the vertical distribution of ice algae in sea ice. In most models, only the bottom ice layer is considered where most of the algal biomass tends to be concentrated. However, since ice algae are also present along the entire ice column, this may lead to underestimation of ice-algal production. Some empirical data and model results suggest that ice algae located in the surface and interior layers may be kept at lower concentrations, in spite of high growth rates, due to grazing by micro- and meiofauna. Results obtained in this study show the importance of resolving vertically the distribution of ice algae to avoid bias in primary production estimates, well in line with empirical studies. },

  abstract = {The Northern Hemisphere polar amplification of climate change is documented in models taking part in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project and in the new version of the Community Climate System Model. In particular, the magnitude, spatial distribution, and seasonality of the surface warming in the Arctic is examined and compared among the models. The range of simulated polar warming in the Arctic is from 1.5 to 4.5 times the global mean warming. While ice-albedo feedback is likely to account for much of the polar amplification, the strength of the feedback depends on numerous physical processes and parametrizations which differ considerably among the models. Nonetheless, the mean sea-ice state in the control (or present) climate is found to influence both the magnitude and spatial distribution of the high-latitude warming in the models. In particular, the latitude of the maximum warming is correlated inversely and significantly with sea-ice extent in the control climate. Additionally, models with relatively thin Arctic ice cover in the control climate tend to have higher polar amplification. An intercomparison of model results also shows that increases in poleward ocean heat transport at high latitudes and increases in polar cloud cover are significantly correlated to amplified Arctic warming. This suggests that these changes in the climate state may modify polar amplification. No significant correlation is found between polar amplification and the control climate continental ice and snow cover.},

  abstract = {In the Arctic Ocean, both phytoplankton and sea ice algae are important contributors to primary production and the arctic food web. An ice algal ecosystem model was added to fully couple with the global physical model POP-CICE (Parallel Ocean Program-Los Alamos Sea Ice Model) and the open-ocean pelagic ecosystem model. The physical model captured the seasonal and interannual variations of northern hemispheric sea ice extent and area measured by satellite remote sensing for the model period of 1992–2007. The model results showed a reasonable mean seasonal cycle of ice algal production from March to May and subsequent ocean production from May to September in the Arctic. The ice algal production, although smaller than that of the ocean, is of ecological importance as a food source for higher trophic levels during the long arctic winter before ice melt. The simulated mean open-ocean upper 100 m primary production within the Arctic Circle was 413±88 T g C yr−1 in the years 1998–2006, close to the remote sensing derived estimate of 419±33 T g C yr−1 but with higher interannual variations. The mean sea ice algal production in the Northern Hemisphere from 1998 to 2007 was 21.3 T g C yr−1, which is in the range of multi-observational estimations of 9–73 T g C yr−1 based on in situ measurements. Model-data comparisons were conducted with various regional observations and the observed trend of temporal and spatial variation of the primary production. The model results compared well with the following observations and observed trends: (1) an increase of ocean primary production from 2003 to 2007 in the arctic open water areas as derived from remote sensing data; (2) regional annual ice and ocean primary production measured in the Bering and Chukchi seas and Canadian Basin; (3) primary production rate with phytoplankton size composition and Chl-a concentration along an arctic cruise track in the Chukchi Sea and Canadian Basin from August 2 to September 7, 2008; and (4) observed decadal changes of ocean primary production from the 1990s to 2007 due to rising temperature and increasing open-ocean area in the western Arctic. The changes are shown as a trend of a northward shift of production, with a decrease in the Bering Sea and an increase in the Arctic shelf. },

  abstract  = {At maximum extent the sea ice covers some 8{\%} of the Southern Hemisphere and 5{\%} of the Northern Hemisphere and thus has a significant influence on the productivity of large ocean areas. The structure, extent and distribution of sea ice not only influences biogenic production within the ice system, but also affects pelagic and benthic systems under the ice and near ice edges. The sea ice in Polar Oceans provides a unique environment utilised by a diverse group of organisms ranging in size from single-celled algae within the ice to meter-long algal assemblages, dominated by diatoms, attached to the lower surface of the ice, and from protozoans to marine mammals. Sea ice (sympagic) biota play an important role in high Arctic food webs. Ice algae may serve as an inocculum for marginal ice zone blooms and form the base of food webs culminating in polar cod (L{\o}nne and Gulliksen 1989), seals (Nilssen et al. 1995) and seabirds (L{\o}nne and Gabrielsen 1992). Matter entering this lipid-rich food web may reach higher trophic levels in areas geographically distant from its place of origin, due to passive transport of sea ice biota in Arctic ice drift (Falk-Petersen et al. 1990},

The model results are compared with data collected from May to July 2002 at a station near Resolute in Barrow Strait. Our results show that ice algae are light limited at the beginning of the bloom, then fluctuate between light and nutrient limitation, finally remaining nutrient limited toward the end of the bloom. The fortnightly tide modulates the ice algal biomass through the supply of nutrient to the ice algal layer but mainly through modulation of the bottom ice melt rate. We also demonstrate that the bottom ice melt rate regulates the maximum biomass attained in the region and that a rapid increase in ice temperature can lead to a significant decline in ice algal biomass. The eventual termination of the bloom is triggered by melting of the snow cover and results from (1) increased ice algal losses due to high bottom ice melt rate and (2) decreased ice algal growth due to nutrient limitation caused by the formation of a meltwater lens below the ice. Finally, our results show that the snow cover controls the length of the bloom, such that earlier snowmelt that is expected to accompany climate warming may lead to a reduction in ice algal production.},

  abstract  = {The partitioning of incident solar radiation between sea ice, ocean, and atmosphere strongly affects the Arctic energy balance during summer. In addition to spectral albedo of the ice surface, transmission of solar radiation through the ice is critical for assessing heat and mass balances of sea ice. Observations of spectral irradiance profiles within and transmittance through ice in the Beaufort Sea during the summer of 1998 during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) are presented. Sites representative of melting multiyear and first-year ice, along with ponded ice were measured. Observed spectral irradiance extinction coefficients (Kλ) show broad minima near 500 nm and strong increases at near-infrared wavelengths. The median Kλ at 600 nm for the bare ice cases is close to 0.8 m−1 and about 0.6 m−1 for ponded ice. Values are considerably smaller than the previously accepted value of 1.5 m−1. Radiative transfer models were used to analyze the observations and obtain inherent optical properties of the ice. Derived scattering coefficients range from 500 m−1 to 1100 m−1 in the surface layer and 8 to 30 m−1 in the ice interior. While ponded ice is known to transmit a significant amount of shortwave radiation to the ocean, the irradiance transmitted through bare, melting ice is also shown to be significant. The findings of this study predict 3–10 times more solar radiation penetrating the ice cover than predicted by a current GCM (CCSM3) parameterization, depending on ice thickness, pond coverage, stage of the melt season, and specific vertical scattering coefficient profile.},

  abstract  = {Three “easy-to-use solvers” are presented for the approximation of pH and the concentrations of protolytic species in marine aqueous systems. The first one is based on the conservation of alkalinity, the second one describes the progress (advancement) of a chemical reaction towards its state of equilibrium, and the third one is based on the conservation of the charges in the system (charge balance). They are developed for steady state or non-steady state modelling, but they are also useful for pH calculations from measured data sets. To demonstrate their numerical stability over a wide range of pH, the solvers are tested with random input values. Internal consistency is checked by mass and charge conservation and by comparing the results of each solver. In closed systems, equilibrium calculations lead to identical pH values and species concentrations, as expected. The three approaches are also tested in a non-steady-state transport-reaction model that simulates early diagenesis in oxic deep-sea sediments as well as in reactive sediments from the deep Arabian Sea. In the model, dissolved carbonate species are either transported as individual species (CO2, HCO3−, CO32−) or as summed variables (TCO2, alkalinity). In the first case, the species are transported according to their individual molecular diffusion coefficients and concentration gradients. In the second case, protolytic species are transported along the gradient of summed concentrations using weighted average diffusion coefficients. The advancement approach is coupled with transport of the individual species, whereas the alkalinity conservation and the charge balance approaches are applied to transport of summed variables. The model results show that the approaches lead to non-negligible differences in the species distribution and the pH. With intensive calcium carbonate dissolution, the thermodynamically-controlled dissolution rates dominate the system; in this case, the differences in the species distribution between the three solvers and the two transport schemes can be neglected, but strong differences in the calculated fluxes between sediment and bottom water can be observed.},

However, the factors controlling future changes in pH and Ωarag are independent and will respond differently to oceanic climate change feedbacks such as ocean warming, circulation and biological changes. We examine the sensitivity of these two CO2-related parameters to climate change feedbacks within a coupled atmosphere-ocean model. The ocean warming feedback was found to dominate the climate change responses in the surface ocean. Although surface pH is projected to decrease relatively uniformly by about 0.3 by the year 2100, we find pH to be insensitive to climate change feedbacks, whereas Ωarag is buffered by ∼15%. Ocean carbonate chemistry creates a situation whereby the direct pH changes due to ocean warming are almost cancelled by the pH changes associated with dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations changes via a reduction in CO2 solubility from ocean warming. We show that the small climate change feedback on future surface ocean pH is independent to the amount of ocean warming. Our analysis therefore implies that future projections of surface ocean acidification only need to consider future atmospheric CO2 levels, not climate change induced modifications in the ocean.},

  abstract = {The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) is one of the few community ocean general circulation models for which a 4-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var) capability has been developed. The \{ROMS\} 4D-Var capability is unique in that three variants of 4D-Var are supported: a primal formulation of incremental strong constraint 4D-Var (I4D-Var), a dual formulation based on a physical-space statistical analysis system (4D-PSAS), and a dual formulation representer-based variant of 4D-Var (R4D-Var). In each case, \{ROMS\} is used in conjunction with available observations to identify a best estimate of the ocean circulation based on a set of a priori hypotheses about errors in the initial conditions, boundary conditions, surface forcing, and errors in the model in the case of 4D-PSAS and R4D-Var. In the primal formulation of I4D-Var the search for the best circulation estimate is performed in the full space of the model control vector, while for the dual formulations of 4D-PSAS and R4D-Var only the sub-space of linear functions of the model state vector spanned by the observations (i.e. the dual space) is searched. In oceanographic applications, the number of observations is typically much less than the dimension of the model control vector, so there are clear advantages to limiting the search to the space spanned by the observations. In the case of 4D-PSAS and R4D-Var, the strong constraint assumption (i.e. that the model is error free) can be relaxed leading to the so-called weak constraint formulation. This paper describes the three aforementioned variants of 4D-Var as they are implemented in ROMS. Critical components that are common to each approach are conjugate gradient descent, preconditioning, and error covariance models, which are also described. Finally, several powerful 4D-Var diagnostic tools are discussed, namely computation of posterior errors, eigenvector analysis of the posterior error covariance, observation impact, and observation sensitivity.},

Bacterial denitrification activity (100–300 nmol N L−1 sea ice d−1) occurred in the lower 0.5 m of the sea ice, which had high concentrations of NO3−, NH4+, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Despite sea-ice algal production in the lower sea-ice layers, heterotrophic activity resulted in a net O2 consumption of 13 µmol O2 L−1 sea ice d−1 in the lower 0.5-m ice layers. Together with melting of deoxygenated ice crystals, this led to anoxic conditions in the brine system favoring conditions for anaerobic NO3− reduction. Numbers of anaerobic NO3−-reducing bacteria in the same ice layers were high (1.1 × 105 cells ml−1 sea ice, corresponding to 1.2 × 106 cells ml−1 brine). Area-integrated denitrification rates were 10–45 µmol N m−2 sea ice d−1, which corresponds to 7–50% of the sediment activity in the area. Although the proportion of anammox to total N2 production was up to 19% in layers of the ice floe from the Greenland Sea, the integrated rate only accounted for 0–5% of total NO3− reduction at the investigated localities.},

  abstract = {Large gradients of dissolved silica are common in the uppermost layers of abyssal marine sediments. These gradients can be sustained only by an active, continuous supply of dissolved silica from within the sediments. The flux of dissolved silica is approximately equivalent to the total accumulation rate of all siliceous material (including aluminosilicates) in the sediments; if aluminosilicates were the source of dissolved silica they would have to give up nearly all of their silicon. Since marine sediments commonly show no such depletion in silicon with depth, dissolution of aluminosilicates cannot be the primary source of dissolved silica emanating from the sea floor. The main source of this flux must be particulate biogenous silica that is mixed downward into the more inert sedimentary material and dissolves leaving little residue. Biological and physical processes stir deep-sea sediments at rates which can be described by vertical mixing coefficients. These coefficients can be evaluated from microtektite redistribution or from the depth profiles of plutonium in sediments. Measured rates range between 0.5 and 400 cm2 kyr−1 in the deep sea. By redistributing reactive particles, this vertical mixing influences the chemical gradients in interstitial waters and the chemical fluxes across the sea-floor boundary. Dissolving particles of silica or calcium carbonate will have more effect on pore water concentrations when they are deeper within the sediment. Model calculations show the input flux of biogenous particulate silica to be the primary controlling factor on the flux of dissolved silica and on the interstitial profile of dissolved silica. Bioturbation rates and dissolution rates also have an important effect on interstitial profiles and this effect can be estimated although the actual rates are poorly known. Model calculations indicate that the concentrations of dissolved species in pore water are controlled by a dynamic balance between competing processes. Equilibrium reactions between sediments in the upper few meters of the sediment column and their associated pore water are almost irrelevant in establishing the composition of the pore waters. Silica solubility is only slightly affected by temperature and pressure changes in the deep sea, and abyssal waters are always far from saturation. Accordingly the water composition can have only a minimal effect on dissolution rates of SiO2. On the other hand, the actual mechanism which prevents dissolution of some siliceous fossils remains unknown. A stagnant boundary layer in water overlying the sea floor will have almost no effect on concentrations or fluxes of silica. Variations in bioturbation rates or in the flux of biogenous particulate silica to the sediment would affect the balance of concentrations in the pore water profile. Such changes over the last few hundred years would be recorded in the composition of pore waters which are associated with sedimentary particles hundreds of thousands of years old. In this sense the “age” of the pore waters is far less than the “age” of the associated solids in the upper meters of the sea floor.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to find a combination of optimal numerical algorithms for time-stepping and mode-splitting suitable for a high-resolution, free-surface, terrain-following coordinate oceanic model. Due to mathematical feedback between the baroclinic momentum and tracer equations and, similarly, between the barotropic momentum and continuity equations, it is advantageous to treat both modes so that, after a time step for the momentum equation, the computed velocities participate immediately in the computation of tracers and continuity, and vice versa, rather than advancing all equations for one time step simultaneously. This leads to a new family of time-stepping algorithms that combine forward–backward feedback with the best known synchronous algorithms, allowing an increased time step due to the enhanced internal stability without sacrificing its accuracy. Based on these algorithms we design a split-explicit hydrodynamic kernel for a realistic oceanic model, which addresses multiple numerical issues associated with mode splitting. This kernel utilizes consistent temporal averaging of the barotropic mode via a specially designed filter function to guarantee both exact conservation and constancy preservation properties for tracers and yields more accurate (up to second-order), resolved barotropic processes, while preventing aliasing of unresolved barotropic signals into the slow baroclinic motions. It has a more accurate mode-splitting due to redefined barotropic pressure-gradient terms to account for the local variations in density field, while maintaining the computational efficiency of a split model. It is naturally compatible with a variety of centered and upstream-biased high-order advection algorithms, and helps to mitigate computational cost of expensive physical parameterization of mixing processes and submodels.},

  abstract = {We present a numerical model of sedimentary early diagenetic processes that includes oxic and anoxic mineralization. The model belongs to the new wave of early diagenesis models that account for depth-dependent bioturbation and porosity profiles; it can be used both for calculating steady-state conditions and transient simulation. It was developed to reproduce the cycling of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen along the ocean margin; it resolves the sediment-depth profiles of carbon, oxygen, nitrate, ammonium, and other reduced substances. Organic carbon is modeled as two degradable fractions with different first-order degradation rates and nitrogen:carbon ratios, to account for the decreasing reactivity and N/C ratio of the organic matter with depth into the sediment. The consumption of oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors is explicitly modeled, and mineralization is limited both by carbon (first order kinetics) and by oxidant availability (Michaelis-Menten type kinetics). Nitrification and oxic mineralization are decoupled, which allows the description of ammonium profiles. Mineralization processes using other oxidants (manganese oxides, iron oxides, sulphate) are lumped into one process, where degradation is only carbon limited; the terminal electron acceptors are not explicitly modeled, only the production of reduced substances is described. These substances are in part permanently removed (e.g., pyrite formation below the bioturbation zone) and partly diffuse towards the oxic layer where they react with oxygen. The values of several parameters were constrained using literature-derived relationships. The model was calibrated on a dataset obtained from the literature, which relates the magnitude of the different pathways to total organic carbon mineralization. The influence of carbon flux, bioturbation, sedimentation rate, bottomwater concentrations of oxygen, and nitrate and carbon degradability on the different mineralization pathways is examined. The relative contribution of the oxic mineralization in the model is significantly depressed under high organic flux, under low bottomwater oxygen conditions and when the bioturbation increases; higher carbon degradability has only a small positive effect, while sedimentation rate is relatively unimportant. Denitrification is mainly influenced by the nitrate concentration in the overlying bottomwater.},

  abstract = {A new ecosystem model – the Ecological Connectivity Hypoxia Model (ECOHYM) – was developed and applied to Tokyo Bay, a hypoxic estuary in Japan. \{ECOHYM\} permits study of the dynamics and mechanisms of hypoxia from two perspectives: (1) the whole estuary, composed of temporal-spatial mutual linkage of benthic–pelagic or central bay-tidal flat ecosystems (holistic approach), and (2) each biochemical and physical process, contributing to oxygen production/consumption (elemental approach). \{ECOHYM\} evaluates the oxygen–carbon–nitrogen–phosphorus-coupled cycle driven by physical and biochemical processes. The processes mechanically describe the ecosystem network consisting of benthic–pelagic and central bay–tidal flat ecosystem coupling. The model also describes the early diagenetic processes of the benthic ecosystems by setting a micro-scale vertical spatial resolution due to the drastic vertical change of benthic biological metabolism and its high contribution to total oxygen consumption. Model variables were mainly selected based on low trophic level; namely, phytoplankton, zooplankton, detritus, dissolved organic matter, NH4–N, NO3–N, PO4–P, benthic algae, suspension feeders, deposit feeders (benthic faunas), dissolved oxygen (DO) and oxygen demand units (ODU, representing the stoichiometric expression of Mn2+, Fe2+ and S2− oxygen demand). Detritus was divided into fast-labile, slow-labile and refractory parts. Bacterial mineralization processes were divided into oxic, suboxic and anoxic fractions. The model was applied for a time frame of 100 years under seasonal forcing functions to achieve an annual periodical steady state. The model results revealed that the seasonal dynamics were more noticeable than the daily/tidal dynamics in the central bay area. In contrast, the daily/tidal dynamics were determinant in the tidal flat area. Calculated seasonal dynamics in the central bay and daily/tidal dynamics in the tidal flat were in good agreement with the observed data. In particular, the model succeeded in reproducing the following vertical \{DO\} profiles during the hypoxic season (summer): (1) high oxygen at the sea-surface and hypoxia at the sea-bottom in the central bay area, (2) the reduced thickness of the benthic oxic layer in the central bay area, and (3) the drastic change of \{DO\} micro-profiles between daytime and nighttime of the benthic system in the tidal flat areas. Oxygen fluxes at the sediment–water interface in the model also reproduced the in situ observed values both in the central bay and tidal flat areas. },

Nonetheless sea ice biogeochemical dynamics at large temporal and spatial scales are still rarely described. Numerical models may potentially contribute integrating among sparse observations, but available models of sea ice biogeochemistry are still scarce, whether their relevance for properly describing the current and future state of the polar oceans has been recently addressed. A general methodology to develop a sea ice biogeochemical model is presented, deriving it from an existing validated model application by extension of generic pelagic biogeochemistry model parameterizations. The described methodology is flexible and considers different levels of ecosystem complexity and vertical representation, while adopting a strategy of coupling that ensures mass conservation. We show how to apply this methodology step by step by building an intermediate complexity model from a published realistic application and applying it to analyze theoretically a typical season of first-year sea ice in the Arctic, the one currently needing the most urgent understanding. The aim is to (1) introduce sea ice biogeochemistry and address its relevance to ocean modelers of polar regions, supporting them in adding a new sea ice component to their modelling framework for a more adequate representation of the sea ice-covered ocean ecosystem as a whole, and (2) extend our knowledge on the relevant controlling factors of sea ice algal production, showing that beyond the light and nutrient availability, the duration of the sea ice season may play a key-role shaping the algal production during the on going and upcoming projected changes.},

The central concept of the coupling is the definition of the Biologically Active Layer, which is the time-varying fraction of sea ice that is connected to the ocean via brine pockets and channels, and acts as a rich habitat for many microorganisms. A simple but comprehensive physical model of the sea ice thermo-halodynamics is coupled to a novel sea ice microalgal model of growth in the framework of the Biogeochemical Flux Model. The physical model provides the key physical properties of the Biologically Active Layer and the biological model simulates the physiological and ecological response of the algal community to the physical environment. Numerical simulations of chl-a were compared with observations at two different ice stations, in the Baltic and off the coast of Greenland, showing that this new coupling structure is sufficiently generic to represent well the temporal and spatial distribution of sea ice algae during the whole ice season at both sites. This model implementation and coupling structure is viable as a new component of General Circulation Models, allowing for estimates of the role and importance of sea ice biology in the local and global carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {The seasonal dynamics of pelagic and sea ice communities are closely related in ice-covered waters, however, modelling works that analyse such interactions are scarce. We use the Biogeochemical Flux Model in Sea Ice (BFM-SI) coupled to the pelagic Biogeochemical Flux Model (BFM) in a study area in Greenland to quantitatively investigate: (1) the significance of photoacclimation/photoadaptation strategies of autotrophs, (2) the fate of the sea ice biomass in case of algae seeding, algae aggregation and at different mixed layer depths and (3) the changes in community production under a climate change scenario. The results show that sea ice algae need to be both photoacclimated and photoadapted to the sea ice environment in order to grow, while phytoplankton may adopt different strategies for optimising their growth. The seeding of the phytoplankton bloom shows to be driven, both in timing and magnitude, by the viability of sea ice algae and by the degree of aggregation of algae released from the ice, which also affects the sinking rate to the sea floor. Under a mild climate change scenario (SRES B2, 2071–2090) the sea ice community is projected to be generally more productive, whereas phytoplankton growth will be reduced because the melt of sea ice will occur earlier in the season when light is less favourable to sustain the growth. While it is generally anticipated that the melting of multi-year ice in the Arctic Ocean will cause an increase in marine production, this study shows that seasonal ice-covered seas in the Northern hemisphere may actually be less productive and may shift to more oligotrophic conditions within the next 100 years.},

  Abstract                 = {Sea ice is one the largest biomes on earth, yet it is poorly described by biogeochemical and climate models. In this paper, published and unpublished data on sympagic (ice-associated) algal biodiversity and productivity have been compiled from more than 300 sea-ice cores and organized into a systematic framework. Significant patterns in microalgal community structure emerged from this framework. Autotrophic flagellates characterize surface communities, interior communities consist of mixed microalgal populations and pennate diatoms dominate bottom communities. There is overlap between landfast and pack-ice communities, which supports the hypothesis that sympagic microalgae originate from the pelagic environment. Distribution in the Arctic is sometimes quite different compared to the Antarctic. This difference may be related to the time of sampling or lack of dedicated studies. Seasonality has a significant impact on species distribution, with a potentially greater role for flagellates and centric diatoms in early spring. The role of sea-ice algae in seeding pelagic blooms remains uncertain. Photosynthesis in sea ice is mainly controlled by environmental factors on a small scale and therefore cannot be linked to specific ice types. Overall, sea-ice communities show a high capacity for photoacclimation but low maximum productivity compared to pelagic phytoplankton. Low carbon assimilation rates probably result from adaptation to extreme conditions of reduced light and temperature in winter. We hypothesize that in the near future, bottom communities will develop earlier in the season and develop more biomass over a shorter period of time as light penetration increases due to the thinning of sea ice. The Arctic is already witnessing changes. The shift forward in time of the algal bloom can result in a mismatch in trophic relations, but the biogeochemical consequences are still hard to predict. With this paper we provide a number of parameters required to improve the reliability of sea-ice biogeochemical models.},

  abstract = {Sea ice ecosystems are characterized by microalgae living in brine inclusions. The growth rate of ice algae depends on light and nutrient supply. Here, the interactions between nutrients and brine dynamics under the influence of algae are investigated using a one-dimensional model. The model includes snow and ice thermodynamics with brine physics and an idealized sea ice biological component, characterized by one nutrient, namely, dissolved silica (DSi). In the model, DSi follows brine motion and is consumed by ice algae. Depending on physical ice characteristics, the brine flow is either advective, diffusive, or turbulent. The vertical profiles of ice salinity and DSi concentration are solutions of advection-diffusion equations. The model is configured to simulate the typical thermodynamic regimes of first-year Antarctic pack ice. The simulated vertical profiles of salinity and DSi qualitatively reproduce observations. Analysis of results highlights the role of convection in the lowermost 5–10 cm of ice. Convection mixes saline, nutrient-poor brine with comparatively fresh, nutrient-rich seawater. This implies a rejection of salt to the ocean and a flux of DSi to the ice. In the presence of growing algae, the simulated ocean-to-ice DSi flux increases by 0–115% compared to an abiotic situation. In turn, primary production and brine convection act in synergy to form a nutrient pump. The other important processes are the flooding of the surface by seawater and the percolation of meltwater. The former refills nutrients near the ice surface in spring. The latter, if present, tends to expell nutrients from the ice in summer.},

  note     = {Sea Ice in the Paleoclimate System: the Challenge of Reconstructing Sea Ice from Proxies},
  abstract = {Observations from the last decade suggest an important role of sea ice in the global biogeochemical cycles, promoted by (i) active biological and chemical processes within the sea ice; (ii) fluid and gas exchanges at the sea ice interface through an often permeable sea ice cover; and (iii) tight physical, biological and chemical interactions between the sea ice, the ocean and the atmosphere. Photosynthetic micro-organisms in sea ice thrive in liquid brine inclusions encased in a pure ice matrix, where they find suitable light and nutrient levels. They extend the production season, provide a winter and early spring food source, and contribute to organic carbon export to depth. Under-ice and ice edge phytoplankton blooms occur when ice retreats, favoured by increasing light, stratification, and by the release of material into the water column. In particular, the release of iron – highly concentrated in sea ice – could have large effects in the iron-limited Southern Ocean. The export of inorganic carbon transport by brine sinking below the mixed layer, calcium carbonate precipitation in sea ice, as well as active ice-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes, could play a central role in the marine carbon cycle. Sea ice processes could also significantly contribute to the sulphur cycle through the large production by ice algae of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), the precursor of sulphate aerosols, which as cloud condensation nuclei have a potential cooling effect on the planet. Finally, the sea ice zone supports significant ocean–atmosphere methane (CH4) fluxes, while saline ice surfaces activate springtime atmospheric bromine chemistry, setting ground for tropospheric ozone depletion events observed near both poles. All these mechanisms are generally known, but neither precisely understood nor quantified at large scales. As polar regions are rapidly changing, understanding the large-scale polar marine biogeochemical processes and their future evolution is of high priority. Earth system models should in this context prove essential, but they currently represent sea ice as biologically and chemically inert. Palaeoclimatic proxies are also relevant, in particular the sea ice proxies, inferring past sea ice conditions from glacial and marine sediment core records and providing analogues for future changes. Being highly constrained by marine biogeochemistry, sea ice proxies would not only contribute to but also benefit from a better understanding of polar marine biogeochemical cycles.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a global ocean implementation of a multi-component model of marine pelagic biogeochemistry coupled on-line with an ocean general circulation model forced with climatological surface fields (PELAgic biogeochemistry for Global Ocean Simulations, PELAGOS). The final objective is the inclusion of this model as a component in an Earth System model for climate studies. The pelagic model is based on a functional stoichiometric representation of marine biogeochemical cycles and allows simulating the dynamics of C, N, P, Si, O and Fe taking into account the variation of their elemental ratios in the functional groups. The model also includes a parameterization of variable chlorophyll/carbon ratio in phytoplankton, carrying chl as a prognostic variable. The first part of the paper analyzes the contribution of non-local advective–diffusive terms and local vertical processes to the simulated chl distributions. The comparison of the three experiments shows that the mean chl distribution at higher latitudes is largely determined by mixing processes, while vertical advection controls the distribution in the equatorial upwelling regions. Horizontal advective and diffusive processes are necessary mechanisms for the shape of chl distribution in the sub-tropical Pacific. In the second part, the results have been compared with existing datasets of satellite-derived chlorophyll, surface nutrients, estimates of phytoplankton community composition and primary production data. The agreement is reasonable both in terms of the spatial distribution of annual means and of the seasonal variability in different dynamical oceanographic regions. Results indicate that some of the model biases in chl and surface nutrients distributions can be related to deficiencies in the simulation of physical processes such as advection and mixing. Other discrepancies are attributed to inadequate parameterizations of phytoplankton functional groups. The model has skill in reproducing the overall distribution of large and small phytoplankton but tends to underestimate diatoms in the northern higher latitudes and overestimate nanophytoplankton with respect to picoautotrophs in oligotrophic regions. The performance of the model is discussed in the context of its use in climate studies and an approach for improving the parameterization of functional groups in deterministic models is outlined.},

The fundamental approach stems from the representation of marine trophic interactions and major biogeochemical cycles introduced in the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM). Our theoretical formulation revisits and generalizes the stoichiometric approach of \{ERSEM\} by defining the state variables as Chemical Functional Families (CFF). \{CFFs\} are further subdivided into living, non-living and inorganic components. Living \{CFFs\} are the basis for the definition of Living Functional Groups, the biomass-based functional prototype of the real organisms. Both \{CFFs\} and \{LFGs\} are theoretical constructs which allow us to relate measurable properties of marine biogeochemistry to the state variables used in deterministic models. This approach is sufficiently generic that may be used to describe other existing biomass-based ecosystem model.},

  abstract = {Substantial increase in atmospheric temperature has been observed over the Siberian Arctic during the last decades, likely a manifestation of climate change as a result of amplified concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This has raised questions about possible feedbacks to the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by processes acting in the ocean and the river drainage basins. Addressing these questions, simulations with different forcings have been performed utilizing a one-dimensional, time‐dependent coupled physical–biogeochemical model that has been optimized for the carbon system in the Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean. The forcings applied are: increased air temperature, wind or river discharge; increased concentration of dissolved organic carbon or nutrients in river runoff; increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or the runoff as well as a combination of five of these forcings. The model simulations reveal a net outgassing of \{CO2\} from the ocean to the atmosphere when the dissolved organic carbon and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in river runoff are doubled. However, an increase in the ocean's ability to take up carbon dioxide occurs if concentration of nutrients in the runoff increases, which is a result of increased primary productivity. The ocean also acts as a stronger sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide when increasing the air temperature, wind speed or the atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide. To reflect the conditions at the end of this century a simulation with changes of several forcing parameters was performed, i.e. with doubled atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 4 °C temperature increase in the air, doubling the runoff dissolved organic carbon concentration, increasing the river discharge by 25% and increasing the wind speed by 10%. This simulation increased the uptake of the ocean by more than five times, from − 0.9 (± 0.3) to − 4.6 (± 1.3) mol C m− 2 y− 1. The main effect is due to the doubling of partial pressure of carbon dioxide. In a model simulation without the increased atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide, the \{CO2\} uptake decreased by 0.2 mol C m− 2 y− 1 to − 0.7 (± 0.6) mol C m− 2 y− 1.},

  abstract = {Global temperature observations during the last century show that the largest increase over the last decades has been manifested in the Arctic, particularly within the Siberian region. The Arctic Ocean is a harsh region with few field studies, resulting in limited temporal and spatial resolution of hydrographical data. One way to circumvent this deficit is to utilise a model that represents processes which are known to possibly impact climate. This has been done for the carbon system in the Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean by utilising a one-dimensional, time dependent coupled physical–biochemical model. This model was validated by observational data of temperature, salinity, phosphate, oxygen and the carbon system. The model simulation reveals that wind pattern is essential for the exchange of dissolved inorganic carbon with the surrounding seas and the carbon dioxide exchange with the atmosphere. The latter is largely driven by the surface water partial pressure of carbon dioxide that is impacted by primary production, water temperature, vertical mixing and river runoff. The model shows that the timing of these factors is critical for the flux of carbon dioxide as is the sea ice coverage. Modelled primary production starts after the disappearance of sea ice and the spring flood has reached the area in June, it peaks in a short time and decreases slowly to negligible levels in mid September. This primary production causes an undersaturation of carbon dioxide with up to 200 μatm during the productive season after which the partial pressure of carbon dioxide increases as the carbon dioxide rich deep water mixes up into the surface layer. However, surface water partial pressure of carbon dioxide is undersaturated all through the year, except for some years when there is a short period of outgasing in the beginning of June. This outgasing occurs when the ice breaks up late and river runoff accumulates under the ice.},

  Abstract                 = {Autotrophic organisms reveal an astounding flexibility in their elemental stoichiometry, with potentially major implications on biogeochemical cycles and ecological functioning. Notwithstanding, stoichiometric regulation and co-limitation by multiple resources in autotrophs \revt{were in the past often} described by heuristic formulations.
In this study, we present a mechanistic model of autotroph growth, which features two major improvements over the existing schemes. First, we introduce the concept of metabolic network independence that defines the degree of phase-locking between accessory machines. Network independence is in particular suggested to be proportional to protein synthesis capability as quantified by variable intracellular N:C. Consequently, the degree of co-limitation becomes variable, contrasting with the dichotomous debate on the use of Liebig's law or the product rule, standing for constantly low and high co-limitation, respectively. Second, we resolve dynamic protein partitioning to light harvesting, carboxylation processes, and to an arbitrary number of nutrient acquisition machineries, as well as instantaneous activity regulation of nutrient uptake. For all regulatory processes we assume growth rate optimality, here extended by an explicit consideration of indirect feed-back effects.
The combination of network independence and optimal regulation displays unprecedented skill in reproducing rich stoichiometric patterns collected from a large number of published chemostat experiments. This high skill indicates (1) that the current paradigm of fixed co-limitation is a critical short-coming of conventional models, and (2) that stoichiometric flexibility in autotrophs possibly reflects an optimality strategy. Numerical experiments furthermore show that regulatory mechanisms homogenize the effect of multiple stressors. Extended optimality alleviates the effect of the most limiting resource(s) while down-regulating machineries for the less limiting ones, which induces an ubiquitous response surface of growth rate over ambient resource levels.},

  abstract = {Application of biogeochemical models to the study of marine ecosystems is pervasive, yet objective quantification of these models' performance is rare. Here, 12 lower trophic level models of varying complexity are objectively assessed in two distinct regions (equatorial Pacific and Arabian Sea). Each model was run within an identical one‐dimensional physical framework. A consistent variational adjoint implementation assimilating chlorophyll‐a, nitrate, export, and primary productivity was applied and the same metrics were used to assess model skill. Experiments were performed in which data were assimilated from each site individually and from both sites simultaneously. A cross‐validation experiment was also conducted whereby data were assimilated from one site and the resulting optimal parameters were used to generate a simulation for the second site. When a single pelagic regime is considered, the simplest models fit the data as well as those with multiple phytoplankton functional groups. However, those with multiple phytoplankton functional groups produced lower misfits when the models are required to simulate both regimes using identical parameter values. The cross‐validation experiments revealed that as long as only a few key biogeochemical parameters were optimized, the models with greater phytoplankton complexity were generally more portable. Furthermore, models with multiple zooplankton compartments did not necessarily outperform models with single zooplankton compartments, even when zooplankton biomass data are assimilated. Finally, even when different models produced similar least squares model‐data misfits, they often did so via very different element flow pathways, highlighting the need for more comprehensive data sets that uniquely constrain these pathways.},

  abstract = {Biological characteristics of ice-associated algal communities were studied in Darnley Bay (western Canadian Arctic) during a 2-week period in July 2008 when the landfast ice cover had reached an advanced stage of melt. We found two distinct and separate algal communities: (1) an interior ice community confined to brine channel networks beneath white ice covers; and (2) an ice melt water community in the brackish waters of both surface melt ponds and the layer immediately below the ice cover. Both communities reached maximum chlorophyll a concentrations of about 2.5 mg m−3, but with diatoms dominating the interior ice while flagellates dominated the melt water community. The microflora of each community was diverse, containing both unique and shared algal species, the latter suggesting an initial seeding of the ice melt water by the bottom ice community. Absorption characteristics of the algae indicated the presence of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and carotenoid pigments as a photoprotective strategy against being confined to high-light near-surface layers. Although likely not contributing substantially to total annual primary production, these ice-associated communities may play an important ecological role in the Arctic marine ecosystem, supplying an accessible and stable food source to higher trophic levels during the period of ice melt.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this study, we successfully implemented a total alkalinity (TA) analyzer in a flow-through setup, in combination with a FerryBox. The high-frequency (10 min) measurements along our ship's route revealed that in coastal systems, where carbon fluxes are dynamic, TA can differ significantly (by up to 100 μmol kg−1) between the nearshore and adjacent coastal regions. Even though this study could not account for the net yearly TA production in the coastal region, it demonstrated that there was a seasonal increase in TA of 100–150 μmol kg−1 in coastal waters of the North Sea, equivalent to TA production of 11.7–26.8 mmol m−2 d−1 during the spring and summer months. This seasonal change could not be accounted for by riverine contributions, but instead was probably related to seasonal organic matter production and processing in coastal and nearshore regions. Bottom sediments and the tidally coupled biogeochemical reactor between coastal (North Sea) and nearshore (Wadden Sea) regions are mediating this TA change, and the ~ 4 months lag between the seasonal increase in alkalinity and the peak organic matter production could be explained by the supply of (labile) organic matter and its temperature-dependent remineralization via both aerobic and anaerobic pathways.},

  abstract = {In recent years the total alkalinity (TA) of seawater has been measured with high precision (∼±2 μmol kg−1) in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. In this paper we have analyzed the surface alkalinity of the major ocean basins using these measurements as well as those obtained during the GEOSECS and TTO studies. The salinity normalized alkalinity (NTA=TA×35/S) in subtropical gyres between 30°S and 30°N is remarkably invariable except in upwelling areas (e.g., the Eastern Equatorial Pacific). The NTA increases toward high latitudes (>30°) and is inversely proportional to sea surface temperature (SST). This increase in NTA with latitude (or decreasing temperature) is attributed to the upward transport of deep waters with higher NTA due to the dissolution of CaCO3(s). The distribution of surface NTA in the major ocean basins shows that the major basins can be divided into regions where different trends of NTA are observed and boundaries between the regions are similar to those of the major ocean currents. The linear behavior of NTA (∼±5 μmol kg−1) with respect to SST makes it possible to provide regional maps of NTA. These maps can be used to estimate TA in surface waters in large areas of the ocean from values of SST and salinity (S). By combining the estimates of TA using SST and S (from the Climatological Atlas of the World Ocean) with underway fCO2 measurements (by ships, moorings, and satellites), it is possible to map the detailed distribution of TCO2 for surface waters over a large area of the ocean. Calculations of TCO2 from measurements of fCO2, SST, and S in the subtropical Pacific Ocean agree with the coulometrically measured values to ±5 μmol kg−1.},

  abstract = {Denitrification on continental margins and in coastal sediments is a major sink of reactive N in the present nitrogen cycle and a major ecosystem service of eutrophied coastal waters. We analyzed the nitrate removal in surface sediments of the Elbe estuary, Wadden Sea, and adjacent German Bight (SE North Sea) during two seasons (spring and summer) along a eutrophication gradient ranging from a high riverine nitrate concentrations at the Elbe Estuary to offshore areas with low nitrate concentrations. The gradient encompassed the full range of sediment types and organic carbon concentrations of the southern North Sea. Based on nitrate penetration depth and concentration gradient in the porewater we estimated benthic nitrate consumption rates assuming either diffusive transport in cohesive sediments or advective transport in permeable sediments. For the latter we derived a mechanistic model of porewater flow. During the peak nitrate discharge of the river Elbe in March, the highest rates of diffusive nitrate uptake were observed in muddy sediments (up to 2.8mmolm−2d−1). The highest advective uptake rate in that period was observed in permeable sediment and was tenfold higher (up to 32mmolm−2d−1). The intensity of both diffusive and advective nitrate consumption dropped with the nitrate availability and thus decreased from the Elbe estuary towards offshore stations, and were further decreased during late summer (minimum nitrate discharge) compared to late winter (maximum nitrate discharge). In summary, our rate measurements indicate that the permeable sediment accounts for up to 90% of the total benthic reactive nitrogen consumption in the study area due to the high efficiency of advective nitrate transport into permeable sediment. Extrapolating the averaged nitrate consumption of different sediment classes to the areas of Elbe Estuary, Wadden Sea and eastern German Bight amounts to an N-loss of 3.1∗106molNd−1 from impermeable, diffusion-controlled sediment, and 5.2∗107molNd−1 from permeable sediment with porewater advection.},

  abstract = {A decade of studies of metal and nutrient inputs to the back-barrier area of Spiekeroog Island, NW German Wadden Sea, have concluded that pore water discharge provides a significant source of the enrichments of many components measured in the tidal channels during low tide. In this paper we add studies of radium isotopes to help quantify fluxes into and out of this system. Activities of radium isotopes in surface water from tidal channels in the back-barrier area exhibit pronounced changes in concert with the tide, with highest activities occurring near low tide. Other dissolved components: silica, total alkalinity (TA), manganese, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exhibit similar changes, with patterns matching the Ra isotopes. Uranium follows a reverse pattern with highest concentrations at high tide. Here we use radium isotope measurements in water column and pore water samples to estimate the fluxes of pore waters that enter the tidal channels during low tide. Using a flushing time of 4 days and the average activities of 224Ra, 223Ra, and 228Ra measured in the back-barrier surface and pore waters, we construct a balance of these isotopes, which is sustained by a deep pore water flux of (2–4)×108L per tidal cycle. This flux transports Ra and the other enriched components to the tidal channels and causes the observed low tide enrichments. An independent estimate of pore water recharge is based on the depletion of U in the tidal channels. The U-based recharge is about two times greater than the Ra-based discharge; however, other sinks of U could reduce the recharge estimate. The pore waters have wide ranges of enrichment in silica, alkalinity, manganese, DOC, and depletion of U with depth. We estimate concentrations of these components in pore water from the depth expected to contribute the majority of the pore water flux, 3.5m, to determine fluxes of these components to the tidal channels. Samples from this depth have minimum concentrations of silica, alkalinity, manganese, and DOC. We also estimate the exports of these components (and import of U) due to mixing based on average measured concentrations in the tidal creeks and the 4-day flushing time. A comparison of these estimates reveals that the exports (negative in the case of U) equal or exceed the pore water fluxes. By using values slightly higher than the minimum concentrations at 3.5m to calculate inputs, the two estimates could be forced to match. We conclude that pore water drainage is the major factor regulating fluxes of Ra isotopes, silica, alkalinity, manganese, DOC, and uranium in this system.},

  abstract = {From 1994 through 1996 transformation processes in the water column of the German Bight and the adjacent Wadden Sea were investigated in the projects TRANSWATT and KUSTOS. On the basis of a review of carbon and nutrient budgets we examine the role of processes in the sediment for overall carbon and nutrient cycling in the Wadden Sea and adjacent German Bight. We distinguish two aspects: the sediment as the site where organic matter is rapidly turned over and the sediment as the site where organic matter and nutrients are immobilized. The relative importance of the sediment for the remineralisation of organic matter depends on the water depth: The review of carbon budgets suggests that in the Wadden Sea (2 - 3 m) about 50{\%} of the remineralisation occurs in the sediment. In the German Bight (20 m), 10 - 20{\%} of the primary production is remineralised in the sediment. The budgets further show that the Wadden Sea is heterotrophic. About 100 gC m-2 y1 is imported from the coastal zone. This implies a net autotrophy of the coastal zone, which is in line with the results from the projects TRANSWATT and KUSTOS. Within the Wadden Sea, organic matter has to be turned over two to three times and in the German Bight three to four times to explain the annual primary production. This is lower than in the offshore North Sea where annual turnover rates up to five have been found. Several processes remove nutrients on longer time-scales from the biogeochemical cycle. The importance of the local formation of phosphorus containing minerals like apatite as a phosphorus sink is shown. A discussion of several denitrification estimates concludes that in the German Bight and adjacent Wadden Sea on average about 8 -16{\%} of the total nitrogen influx (from the coastal zone, from rivers and via the atmosphere) is lost to the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Total alkalinity (TA) is one of the few measurable quantities that can be used together with other quantities to calculate concentrations of species of the carbonate system (CO2, HCO3−, CO32−, H+, OH−). TA and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are conservative quantities with respect to mixing and changes in temperature and pressure and are, therefore, used in oceanic carbon cycle models. Thus it is important to understand the changes of TA due to various biogeochemical processes such as formation and remineralization of organic matter by microalgae, precipitation and dissolution of calcium carbonate. Unfortunately deriving such changes from the common expression for TA in terms of concentrations of non-conservative chemical species (HCO3−, CO32−, B(OH)4−, H+, OH−, etc.) is rarely obvious. Here an expression for TA (TAec) in terms of the total concentrations of certain major ions (Na+, Cl−, Ca2+ etc.) and the total concentrations of various acid-base species (total phosphate etc.) is derived from Dickson's original definition of TA under the constraint of electroneutrality. Changes of TA by various biogeochemical processes are easy to derive from this so-called explicit conservative expression for TA because each term in this expression is independent of changes of temperature or pressure within the ranges normally encountered in the ocean and obeys a linear mixing relation. Further, the constrains of electroneutrality for nutrient uptake by microalgae and photoautotrophs are discussed. A so-called nutrient-H+-compensation principle is proposed. This principle in combination with TAec allows one to make predictions for changes in TA due to uptake of nutrients that are consistent with observations. A new prediction based on this principle is the change in TA due to nitrogen fixation followed by remineralization of organic matter and subsequent nitrification of ammonia which implies a significant sink of TA in tropical and subtropical regions where most of the nitrogen fixation takes place.},

We illustrate an approach for using this estimator of Chl: C to calculate phytoplankton population growth rate from measured primary productivity. This adaptive Chl: C model gives rise to interactive light-nutrient effects in which growth efficiency increases with nutrient availability under low-light conditions. One implication of this interaction is the enhancement of phytoplankton growth efficiency, in addition to enhancement of biomass yield, as a response to eutrophication.},

In situ microsensor measurements showed large changes in oxygen and sulfide concentrations in the top 10 cm, depending on tides and waves. The observed dynamics and high aerobic degradation rates imply that pressure gradients drive advective influx of oxygen and organic material from the water column into the sediments. Our results show that intertidal porous sand plates have high aerobic degradation rates, despite having an organic matter content that is one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of fine-grained deposits with similar decomposition rates.},

The sampling sites represent the range of sediments found in the back-barrier tidal area of Spiekeroog Island: sands, mixed and muddy flats. The correspondingly different contents in organic matter, metals, and porosities lead to significant differences in the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria with volumetric sulfate reduction rates (SRR) in the top 15 cm of up to 1.4 $\mu$mol cm−3 day−1. Depth-integrated areal SRR ranged between 0.9 and 106 mmol m−2 day−1, with the highest values found in the mudflat sediments and lower rates measured in sands at the same time, demonstrating the impact of both temperature and organic matter load. According to a modeling approach for a 154-km2 large tidal area, about 39, 122, and 285 tons of sulfate are reduced per day, during winter, spring/autumn, and summer, respectively. Hence, the importance of areal benthic organic matter mineralization by microbial sulfate reduction increases during spring/autumn and summer by factors of about 2 and 7, respectively, when compared to winter time. The combined results correspond to an estimated benthic organic carbon mineralization rate via sulfate reduction of 78 g C m−2 year−1.},

  abstract = {Abstract Sulfide accumulated as a result of microbial sulfate reduction in sediments and the bottom waters of stratified systems can be re-oxidized via an array of biotic and abiotic reactions. A one-dimensional diffusion-reaction model was developed and applied to 4 yr of physical and chemical data from the stratified water column of the Chesapeake Bay in order to quantify the impact of different sulfide oxidation processes at the redox interface during slack tide. This dataset and the model simulations highlight short-term and interannual variation in the physical structure and the distribution of key redox species (O2, H2S, S0, Fe2+, Mn2+, FeOOH, MnO2) throughout the water column. The model evaluates links between oxygen, sulfur, iron and manganese cycling, and includes the novel consideration of sulfide oxidation by phototrophic sulfide oxidizing bacteria (PSOB), which are a common component of the Bay. Model simulations demonstrate that phototrophic sulfide oxidation can account for up to 58\% of total sulfide oxidation, depending upon the depth of the oxic/anoxic interface. The results of this study yield an approach to parameterizing PSOB activity, and quantify the variable role that PSOB play in sulfide oxidation in the Chesapeake Bay as redox conditions in the water column change, which has applications for both modern and ancient environments.},

  abstract = {A 1D hydrophysical-biogeochemical model was developed to study the cycling of the main elements in the pelagic redox layer in seas with anoxic conditions. The formation and decay of organic matter; the reduction and oxidation of nitrogen, sulfur, manganese, and iron species; and the transformation of phosphorus species were parameterized. Temporal and spatial developments of the model's variables were described by a system of horizontally integrated vertical diffusion equations for non-conservative substances. The calculated spatial and temporal distributions of the above-mentioned parameters were in good agreement with observed vertical distribution patterns of these processes. To study the influence of seasonal variability on the chemical structure of the pelagic redox layer, specific and distinct hydrophysical scenarios for the Black Sea and for the Baltic Sea were used. The results clearly showed that organic matter, formed during the bloom periods by phytoplankton, exerts a major and direct influence on the structure of the remote redox interface in both seas as well as on the processes occurring in them. This is due to competition for dissolved oxygen between its consumption for oxidation of organic matter originating in the euphotic layer and the consumption for oxidation of reductants supplied from the anoxic deep water. As a result, ammonification, nitrification, denitrification and sulfate reduction dominate in the spring and summer, while the oxidation of reduced forms of metals and of hydrogen sulfide dominates in the winter.},

  abstract = {Production of shell lime by the edible cockle Cerastoderma (Cardium) edule living on the tidal flats of the Dutch Wadden Sea was assessed from estimates gathered twice-annually during the period 1968 to 1982 on abundance, age composition and growth rates at 15 sampling places on Balgzand, a 50 km2 tidal flat area. Large-scale surveys showed Balgzand to be a representative for the 1300 km2 tidal flats of the Dutch Wadden Sea. Calcimass of the shells of the standing stock of living cockles increased during the period of observation from about 50 to about 200 g · m−2. The long-term average amounted to 104 g · m−2. Mean annual values for production and elimination were estimated at 118 and 114 g · m−2 · a−1, respectively. Turn-over rates thus amounted to about 1.1 a−1. As a consequence of the high between-years variability of the rates of both recruitment and mortality, all population parameters varied strongly from year to year. Mean annual carbonate production by cockles on the tidal flats of the Wadden Sea is estimated at 234 thousand m3 (156 million kg) but this estimate is far from precise (95% confidence limits being about 100 to 400 thousand m3). About 34 of this quantity will become available for shell fishery. The present level of exploitation of the stock of cockle shells slightly exceeds the lower limit of the long-term production estimate.},
